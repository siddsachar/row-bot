"""Safe wrapper around ``nicegui.ui.timer``.

Background timers scheduled against per-client UI state can outlive
the client that owns them (e.g. when a tab is closed, when NiceGUI
replaces a container during rebuild, or when a client socket drops).
When the callback next fires, NiceGUI raises errors such as
``RuntimeError: parent slot has been deleted`` or ``client ... is
deleted``.  These floods are benign but noisy and, under heavy load,
cause event-loop stalls.

``safe_timer`` wraps the callback so the first such error
deactivates the timer instead of re-raising on every tick.
