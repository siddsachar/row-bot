"""Local development addresses for Row-Bot's managed browser (F4, decision D5).

An address on this computer (``localhost``, ``*.localhost``, ``127.0.0.1``,
``[::1]``) opens only after the person allows it for one conversation, one
origin at a time, through the approval gate; a server Row-Bot itself started
in that conversation and is listening on the port is allowed without asking.
Grants expire after an hour and the person can remove them sooner.

Every other private-network address (another computer on the network, a
router page, cloud metadata) stays blocked: no grant ever covers one.
