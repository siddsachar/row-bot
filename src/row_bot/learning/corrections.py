"""Next-message corrections (O12) and the redo that shows a corrected action (O87).

**Next-message corrections.** Capture marks every turn the person started right after a reply with
``Episode.follows_decision_id`` (L0b); whether that message corrected the reply is decided here,
later, by a fixed rule over the message's opening words (no model call). False corrections are
worse than missed ones (a good reply would be left out of training and drafted against), so the
rule is conservative:

- a **correction** opens by saying the reply was wrong ("No, …", "That's not right", "Wrong file",
  "You used the old policy", "I asked for …", "Hmm, not quite: …");
- an opening that thanks, agrees or moves on ("No worries", "No thanks", "Great, now …"), a
  question, or anything else is **not** a correction;
- an opening that may or may not correct ("Actually, …", "Wait, …", "Are you sure?") is
  **ambiguous** and stays out, like a correction the person **withdrew** in the message after it
  ("Never mind, you were right").

Each confirmed one becomes a ``next_message_correction`` Signal on the corrected reply, dated when
Learning confirmed it (so the held-out count, which walks corrections by that date, never skips one,
``holdout``). It is judged only after the correcting turn ended and the conversation had time to say
more (:data:`SETTLE_SECONDS`), and only when the message came within :data:`MAX_GAP_SECONDS` of the
reply. Imported past chats (partial) get them too: they are evidence for diagnosis, never hidden
problems (O89).

**Redos.** A corrected decision's *corrected action* is what Row-Bot did next, once the person was
happy: the first model call of the turn that redid it (after a confirmed next-message correction or
the app's Retry), when that turn finished and nothing corrected, stopped or retried it in turn
(:func:`accepted_redo`). A Teach with no redo has no corrected action yet.

This module reads only ``learning.db``; it never imports the audit vault (E10).
