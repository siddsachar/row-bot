"""The untouched starting model, made runnable so a first version can be compared with it (L2c2).

UX §5: a version is compared with the version in use, or, for v1, with **the untouched starting
model**. That model is exported once, as it is (no adapter: llama.cpp's converter and
``llama-quantize`` at the recipe's quantization, through the training engine), into
``learning_models/base/<model id>/``, and served where the version it is compared with runs: in
Row-Bot's own server as ``row-bot-personal-base`` (the default, O75) or in Ollama as
``row-bot-personal-base:<tag>``: a reserved name, so it never shows in a model list and never reads as
"Answered by your personal model". The pair then differs only by training. Only Row-Bot's probe is checked (the untouched model never learned Row-Bot's tool bridge,
so its tool turn isn't a readiness test, it is what the comparison measures). It is unloaded after
its checks and removed with **Delete version** of the last version, or **Remove engine**.
