"""Learning (preview): the switch.

Importing this package loads nothing else from ``row_bot.learning``: no store,
no database connection, no thread. Later seams call :func:`is_enabled` on every
model call, so it is a cached read of the saved setting that is re-read only
when the settings file changes (or :func:`invalidate` is called), and it says
``False`` whenever the setting can't be read.

Learning is off by default. While it is off nothing under ``row_bot.learning``
is imported, and the data folder holds no Learning file until Learning is first
turned on: ``learning.db`` and ``learning/blobs/`` are created by the first
enable or by the first write while it is on (``store.py``). Turning it off keeps
the data until the person deletes it.

The capture seams (``agent``, the approval gate, Retry, the Slack and Discord
handlers) call :func:`is_enabled` first and import ``capture`` only when it is on;
:func:`note_retry` and :func:`note_channel_sender` are those guards for the
seams outside the Agent.

Settings live in ``learning_config.json`` in the data folder::

    {"enabled": false, "paused": false,
     "sources": {"my_chats": true, "workflows_and_goals": true, "past_chats": true},
     "apply_mode": "ask_first", "monthly_token_limit": 2000000,
     "train_in_quiet_hours": true, "train_where": "this_computer",
     "starting_model": "qwen3.5-2b", "model_download": "not_asked"}

**The preview flag (O34).** Until the 5.4 cut, Learning exists only in a build
started with ``ROW_BOT_LEARNING_PREVIEW=1``. The flag is read once, when this
package is imported at start-up; it is a build gate, not a setting. Without it
Learning is off whatever the settings say: :func:`read_settings` reports it off,
:func:`is_enabled` is false, nothing is recorded and the Learning API answers
"unavailable".

**Pause.** A paused Learning stays on (its settings, changes and models in use are
kept) but records, tests and trains nothing: :func:`is_enabled` is false while it is
paused, at the same one cached read.
