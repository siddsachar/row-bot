# Source Layout And Packaging

Row-Bot runtime source lives in `src/row_bot/`. New application modules and
runtime packages should be added there and imported as `row_bot.*`.

The repository root still keeps a small supported launch surface:

- `app.py` runs `row_bot.app` from a checkout or packaged payload.
- `launcher.py` imports and calls `row_bot.launcher.main`.
- Root payload assets such as `static/`, `sounds/`, `bundled_skills/`,
  `tool_guides/`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, generated `requirements.txt`,
  and `row-bot.ico` remain at the root for the v4 packaging contract.

Do not add implementation code to the root wrappers. If code needs to be shared
with tests, installers, or scripts, place it under `src/row_bot/` or in a
non-runtime helper under `scripts/`.

## Running From Source

From the repository root:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install "uv>=0.7,<1.0"
uv sync --locked --all-extras --group test
uv run python launcher.py
```

`pyproject.toml` owns direct dependencies and extras. `requirements.txt` is generated from `uv.lock` with `python scripts/export_locked_requirements.py` for pip-based installers and should not be edited by hand.

Server/headless mode:

```powershell
python launcher.py --server --no-open --port 8080
```

Direct NiceGUI launch remains supported through the root wrapper:

```powershell
python app.py
```

Tests import package modules through `pytest.ini`, which sets `pythonpath =
src`. Ad hoc scripts that import `row_bot.*` directly should either run through
the root launchers, set `PYTHONPATH=src`, or insert the checkout's `src/`
directory explicitly.

## Packaging Payloads

`scripts/app_payload_manifest.py` is the source of truth for application payload
coverage. The manifest currently separates the package into:

- `payload_dirs`: recursive runtime package directories, currently
  `src/row_bot`.
- `asset_dirs`: root asset directories copied beside the launchers, currently
  `static`, `sounds`, `bundled_skills`, and `tool_guides`.
- `root_python_files`: supported root Python launch wrappers discovered from the
  repository root, excluding debug, test, and harness files.
- `root_files`: root files required by packaged apps, including
  `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `requirements.txt`, and `row-bot.ico`.
- `runtime_script_files`: package-time runtime verification scripts.

Windows packaging uses `installer/row_bot_setup.iss` to recursively include
`src/row_bot`. macOS and Linux builders call `scripts/app_payload_manifest.py`
for root files, runtime scripts, payload directories, and asset directories.
Packaging tests in `tests/test_linux_support.py` and `tests/test_suite.py`
assert those contracts.

Because `src/row_bot` is recursive, the 4.5.0 Agent execution budget and
settings modules, native Computer Use package and pinned runtime manifest,
cache-only embedding fallback, mobile companion, cancellation helpers,
provider transports, and channel streaming modules require no per-file
installer entries. `tests/test_linux_support.py` keeps required runtime
packages in the cross-platform payload inventory, while
`tests/subsystem/installer/test_computer_use_package_data.py` verifies that the
Computer Use JSON manifest survives both wheel and installer packaging.

## Local Cleanup Candidates

These paths are generated local state and should stay untracked:

- `installer/build/`
- `dist/`
- `.tmp/`, `.tmp_pytest/`, `.testtmp/`, `.pytest_cache/`, and `test-results/`
- `.streamlit/` from the old Streamlit app
- `src/row_bot/channels/whatsapp_bridge/node_modules/`

Do not recursively delete ignored/generated directories during implementation
work unless the owner explicitly confirms it is safe. Report them as cleanup
candidates instead.
