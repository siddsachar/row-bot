        """
# Getting Started

Start here if you are new to Row-Bot. You only need three things for a useful first session: the app installed, one working model path, and a basic understanding of where Row-Bot stores local data.

## The Short Path

1. Install Row-Bot from the release package for your platform.
2. Launch the app and complete the first-run wizard.
3. Choose one model path: local Ollama, a hosted provider, a subscription account, or a custom endpoint.
4. Send a first chat message.
5. Open Settings later when you are ready for documents, workflows, Designer, Developer, channels, MCP, plugins, Skills, Buddy, or voice.

## Important Concepts

- **Local app** means Row-Bot runs on your machine and opens a local desktop or browser window.
- **Data directory** means the folder where Row-Bot keeps conversations, memories, documents, settings, workflows, logs, Designer projects, Developer workspaces, skills, plugins, and local integration state.
- **Model provider** means the service or local runtime that supplies a model. Ollama is local; API and subscription providers usually use the internet.
- **Tools** are actions Row-Bot can take, such as reading files, searching documents, using a browser, running Developer commands, or sending through a channel.
- **Approvals** are prompts that ask you to review sensitive actions before Row-Bot proceeds.

        "Install Row-Bot from a release package or run it from source with clear next steps.",
        """
# Installation

For ordinary use, install Row-Bot from the latest release package for your operating system. Running from source is useful for contributors, testers, and people who want to inspect or modify the app.

## Install From A Release

1. Download the latest Row-Bot release for Windows, macOS, or Linux.
2. Run the installer or unpack the archive.
3. Launch Row-Bot from the Start Menu, Applications, app launcher, or the provided command.
4. Let the first-run wizard open and choose a model path.

The installed app starts a local Row-Bot process and opens the UI in a desktop window or browser, depending on your platform and launch preference. If the usual port is busy, Row-Bot chooses another local port.

## Run From Source

Use the source path if you are developing Row-Bot or testing changes:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a Python environment.
3. Install uv and sync the locked Python dependencies with `uv sync --locked --all-extras --group test`.
4. Install the docs-site dependencies only if you are working on documentation.
5. Run the app entry point from the repository.

`requirements.txt` is a generated pip export from `uv.lock` for installer compatibility. It is available as a fallback for environments that cannot use uv, but source dependency changes should be made in `pyproject.toml`.

Source runs use the same local data concepts as the packaged app. Keep test data separate from personal data when experimenting.

## Local Data Directory

Row-Bot stores local app data under the active Row-Bot data directory. This includes conversations, memories, model/provider metadata, workflows, Designer projects, Developer workspace records, documents, logs, skills, plugins, Buddy assets, channel settings, and MCP settings.

Advanced users can set `ROW_BOT_DATA_DIR` before launch to use a separate data directory for testing or portable runs. Do this before starting the app, and remember that Row-Bot will treat that folder as the active local data store for the whole process.

## After Installing

Continue to [First Launch](/docs/getting-started/first-launch). You can finish optional setup later from the Setup Center and Settings.

    write(
        "getting-started/first-launch.mdx",
        "First Launch",
        "Complete the first-run wizard, choose a model path, and revisit setup later.",
        """
# First Launch

The first-run wizard appears until setup is complete. Its job is to help you connect one working model path so Row-Bot can answer a first chat message. Everything else can be configured later.

<Screenshot id="first-launch-setup-wizard" alt="Row-Bot first launch setup wizard." caption="The first-run wizard helps you choose a local, hosted, subscription, or custom model path before optional setup begins." />

## Choose A Model Path

A model is the AI system that writes responses and reasons through tasks. Row-Bot can work with several kinds of model providers:

| Path | Good For | Tradeoffs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local Ollama | Privacy-focused local chats and tool use when your machine has enough resources. | Requires installing models locally. Larger models need more memory and disk space. |
| Hosted API provider | Strong models without local downloads. | Requires an API key, internet access, and provider billing. Prompt content can be sent to that provider. |
| Subscription account | Using a supported account-backed provider from inside Row-Bot. | Requires sign-in or token import and follows that provider's account terms. |
| Custom endpoint | Advanced local or self-hosted runtimes such as LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp, LocalAI, LiteLLM, or SGLang. | Requires endpoint details and compatible model behavior. Tool use needs enough context and function-calling support. |

For beginners, start with the provider path you already trust. If you are unsure, Ollama is the simplest local-first path, while an API provider is usually the quickest path to strong hosted models.

## Setup Center

<Screenshot id="setup-center" alt="Row-Bot Setup Center." caption="Setup Center lets you finish optional setup areas later without blocking the first chat." />

Setup Center is the place to finish or revisit optional setup after the first launch. It can guide you through models, documents, workflows, Designer, Developer, channels, accounts, MCP, plugins, Buddy, and voice. The wizard gets you started; Setup Center helps you build out the rest of your app over time.

## Privacy, Cost, And Credentials

Local model runs can stay on your machine. Hosted, subscription, realtime voice, web search, account, channel, MCP, and plugin features can contact outside services when configured and used. Provider keys and account tokens should be entered only through the relevant Settings or account flow. Cost depends on the provider or service you choose.

## Troubleshooting

- If the wizard cannot find a local model, start Ollama and install a model first.
- If a hosted provider connects but no models appear, refresh Providers and Models.
- If you skip optional setup, open Setup Center or Settings later.

        "Navigate Row-Bot's sidebar, threads, Home tabs, Activity Center, Buddy, Settings, and terminal.",
        """
# Row-Bot Interface

The Row-Bot Interface is the main workspace you see after launch. It combines conversations, Home tabs, status panels, approvals, workflows, Buddy, Settings, and terminal output in one local app window.

<Screenshot id="app-shell-overview" alt="Row-Bot main interface." caption="The main interface shows the left sidebar, Home tabs, central work area, Activity Center, Buddy, Settings, and terminal." />

## Left Sidebar

- **Home** returns to the Home tabs: Workflows, Designer, Developer, Knowledge, and Monitor.
- **New** starts a fresh conversation thread.
- **Conversations** shows recent threads. The sidebar keeps the list short so the workspace stays usable; use **Show all** when you need older threads.
- **Thread menu** on a conversation row opens actions such as rename and delete.
- **Rename** changes the visible thread title without changing the messages.
- **Delete** removes the thread after confirmation. Use it carefully if you still need the conversation history.
- **Agent profiles** opens the profile selector and profile management area.
- **Buddy** appears near the bottom when enabled.
- **Settings** opens the full configuration dialog.

## Show All Threads

When you have more threads than the sidebar shows, use Show All from the conversations area. The dialog is for search and cleanup: find an older thread, reopen it, rename it, or delete it after confirming. Start a new thread when the task has a new goal; continue an existing thread when the earlier context still matters.

## Home Tabs

The central Home area has five tabs:

- **Workflows** for saved automations and background agents.
- **Designer** for starting design projects.
- **Developer** for opening code workspaces and Custom Tools.
- **Knowledge** for memory, document, and graph review.
- **Monitor** for logs, journals, channel state, and background activity.

Home pages in these docs are short entry-point pages. The dedicated feature pages are the full guides.

## Activity Center And Right Drawer

The right side summarizes what needs attention:

- **Current goals and agents** shows running or waiting goal-mode and child-agent activity.
- **Approvals** shows pending approval prompts from chats, child agents, and background work.
- **Workflows** shows active and upcoming workflow state, plus run and new controls.
- **Launch** lets you choose a workflow and run it manually.
- **Insights** expands supporting status and suggestions when available.

Use the Activity Center when you want to know whether Row-Bot is idle, waiting for you, running background work, or ready to launch a workflow. Child-agent approvals also appear in the parent thread so you can decide without leaving the conversation.

## Terminal Panel

The terminal panel at the bottom shows command-oriented output when a tool, Developer workspace, or local runtime exposes it through the UI. It is not a general replacement for your system terminal. Command execution still follows Row-Bot's active tool availability, workspace boundaries, and approval mode.

## Agent Profiles

Agent profiles change how Row-Bot behaves for a thread or specialist run. The sidebar profile control opens the profile selector; the detailed walkthrough is in [Agent Profiles](/docs/app-shell/agent-profiles).

## What Is Saved

Threads, thread names, selected models, profile choices, workflow records, knowledge records, settings, and logs are saved in the local Row-Bot data directory. Some choices are thread-specific; Settings usually changes global app behavior.

## Troubleshooting

- If a thread is missing from the sidebar, open Show All and search.
- If a panel looks stale, use the visible refresh control or reload the app.
- If a button is disabled, check the related Settings tab and Monitor for readiness messages.

# Agent Profiles

Agent Profiles are presets for how Row-Bot should act. A profile can change tone, tool availability, skill hints, approval posture, and specialist behavior. Use them when the same app needs to behave differently for research, coding, planning, design, or careful local-only work.

## Where To Find Profiles

Open the **Agent profiles** area in the left sidebar, or use the profile control in a chat header when it is visible. The dialog lets you choose a profile for the current thread and inspect available built-in profiles.

## What The Profile Dialog Does

- **Profile list** shows available built-in and local profiles.
- **Selected profile** is the behavior Row-Bot will use for the current thread or new specialist run.
- **Description** explains what the profile is optimized for.
- **Tools and skills** indicate which capabilities the profile may prefer or restrict.
- **Default behavior** explains whether the profile is meant for general chat, Agent Mode, Developer work, Designer work, or controlled tasks.
- **Save or apply** records the choice for the current thread when the dialog offers it.

## Practical Examples

- Use a research-style profile for web and document synthesis.
- Use a coding profile inside Developer Studio so Row-Bot pays attention to files, commands, tests, and change review.
- Use a cautious profile when you want more approvals and less external activity.
- Use a design profile when you are working in Designer Studio and want visual output iteration.

## What Is Saved

Profile selection can be saved on a thread, so future turns keep the same behavior. Built-in profile definitions are part of Row-Bot; local custom profiles are stored in local app data when supported.

## Privacy And Safety

A profile can influence which tools Row-Bot prefers, but it does not bypass approvals. If a profile enables broader tool use, review approval prompts before allowing file writes, browser actions, shell commands, account actions, MCP calls, plugin tools, or channel sends.

## Troubleshooting

- If Row-Bot behaves too narrowly, switch back to a general profile.
- If a tool is unavailable, check both the profile and the related Settings tab.
- If a profile choice does not stick, confirm you applied it to the active thread.

# Chat

Chat is the main place to ask Row-Bot for help. A chat thread can stay simple, or it can use models, memory, documents, tools, approvals, attachments, skills, voice, workflows, and specialist profiles.

<Screenshot id="chat-main" alt="Row-Bot chat view with conversation and composer controls." caption="The chat view shows the active conversation, model context, tool-result history, and message composer controls." />

## UI Walkthrough

- **Thread header** shows the current thread title and actions such as rename, profile selection, model state, and export when available.
- **Transcript** contains user messages, assistant responses, tool results, charts, images, reasoning sections, and status messages.
- **Composer** is where you type the next request. Use plain language and include the outcome you want.
- **Send** submits the composer text to the selected model.
- **Stop** appears while Row-Bot is responding and asks the current run to stop.
- **Regenerate or retry controls** appear when a response can be run again.
- **Model picker** chooses the model for this thread. See [Model Picker](/docs/chat/model-picker).
- **Approval mode** controls how sensitive actions are reviewed for this thread.
- **Attachments and context controls** add files or local context to the current request.
- **Skills and slash commands** help start structured tasks when available.
- **Voice buttons** use Dictate or Talk when voice is configured.
- **Tool traces** show what tools Row-Bot used and what came back.
- **Approval prompts** pause gated actions until you approve or reject them. When a child agent needs approval, the prompt appears in the parent thread too.

## Beginner Workflow

1. Start a new thread.
2. Choose a model that is ready for chat.
3. Ask one clear question or task.
4. Attach files only when the task needs them.
5. Review any approval prompt before allowing Row-Bot to act.
6. Rename the thread when it becomes useful enough to keep.

## Power Workflow

1. Choose an Agent Profile for the kind of work.
2. Pick a stronger tool-capable model.
3. Attach documents or enable retrieval only for relevant context.
4. Let Row-Bot use tools, but approve file writes, browser actions, shell commands, account actions, channel sends, MCP calls, and plugin tools deliberately.
5. Export or continue the thread after the work is complete.

## What Is Saved

Thread names, messages, selected model overrides, approval mode, profile selection, attachments copied into Row-Bot-managed storage, and tool results are saved locally. Some external providers may receive prompt content when you choose their models.

## Privacy And Safety

Local model runs can stay on your machine. Hosted models, web search, browser actions, account tools, MCP servers, plugins, and channels can send data outside the app when configured and used. Row-Bot should not insert secrets into chat; enter credentials only through Settings or the provider's sign-in flow.

## Troubleshooting

- If Row-Bot cannot answer with the current model, choose a more capable model in the picker.
- If attachments are ignored, confirm the files finished uploading and are relevant to the prompt.
- If a tool is unavailable, check Settings, the current Agent Profile, and approval mode.
- If a run is stuck, press Stop, then retry with a narrower prompt.

        """
# Model Picker

The Model Picker chooses which model powers the current chat thread. It is where provider setup becomes visible in day-to-day use.

## Where Models Come From

Models appear after Row-Bot discovers them from a connected provider or local runtime:

- Local Ollama models come from the Ollama service running on your machine.
- API provider models come from a provider connected in Settings -> Providers.
- Subscription models come from a supported account-backed provider after sign-in or token import.
- Custom endpoint models come from the compatible endpoint details you provide.
- Pinned Quick Choices come from Settings -> Models and are shown first for convenience.

## UI Walkthrough

- **Pinned models** are your quick picks for everyday use.
- **Provider groups** keep local, API, subscription, and custom endpoint models understandable.
- **Search** narrows long model lists.
- **Capability labels** help distinguish chat, tool-capable, vision, reasoning, embedding, media, and voice models.
- **Disabled or missing providers** stay out of normal selection until they are configured and healthy.
- **Thread override** means the selected model applies to the active thread without changing your global default.

## Choosing Well

Use a smaller or local model for quick private chats. Use a stronger tool-capable model for workflows, Developer Studio, Designer Studio, long context, or multi-step tool use. For local and self-hosted endpoints, prefer a context window large enough for Row-Bot's instructions and tool schemas.

## Pinning Models

Open Settings -> Models, refresh the catalog, and pin the models you use often. Pinning does not create a new model; it just puts an existing discovered model into your Quick Choices.

## Troubleshooting

- If a model is missing, refresh Providers, then refresh Models.
- If a provider is connected but disabled, review the provider row message.
- If a model appears but fails with tools, choose a model labeled or tested for Agent Mode.
- If custom endpoint models look duplicated, use the provider-qualified name.

        """
# Tools, Approvals, And Terminal

Tools are actions Row-Bot can take beyond writing text. They can search documents, read files, use a browser, run Developer commands, create designs, inspect knowledge, call MCP servers, use plugins, or send through channels.

## How Tool Use Appears

When Row-Bot uses a tool, the transcript can show a tool trace or result block. Read it as an activity receipt: what Row-Bot tried, what came back, and whether more action is needed.

## Approval Prompts

Approval prompts appear when an action can change local files, run commands, contact external systems, use accounts, start servers, send messages, call MCP/plugin tools, or do something else that deserves review.

If a child agent needs approval, Row-Bot posts a compact approval prompt in the parent thread, keeps the desktop Activity Center in sync, and routes channel-started work back to the originating channel when possible. The prompt may include a short model-written reason, but Row-Bot's approval policy still decides whether the action is blocked, allowed, or waiting for you.

Before approving, check:

- What action is being requested.
- What file, workspace, account, channel, server, or provider is involved.
- Whether the action can send data outside the app.
- Whether the proposed command or file change matches your request.
- Whether rejecting is safer until you inspect settings.

Approving lets Row-Bot continue that action. Rejecting stops that action and returns control to the conversation. On small screens and in channels, prompts stay brief; open the thread or Activity Center when you need more context.

## Terminal Output

The terminal panel shows command-style output when Row-Bot surfaces it from local tools, Developer Studio, or related runtime activity. It is a review surface, not permission by itself. Commands still follow workspace boundaries, tool availability, and approval mode.

## Common Workflow

1. Ask for a task that may need tools.
2. Let Row-Bot explain the intended action.
3. Review the approval prompt.
4. Approve only if the action matches your intent.
5. Inspect the tool trace or terminal output.
6. Ask Row-Bot to summarize what changed.

## Troubleshooting

- If no approval appears, the action may be read-only or blocked before execution.
- If a tool result is confusing, ask Row-Bot to explain the last tool call.
- If command output is missing, check whether you are in Developer Studio or a tool-capable context.
- If you rejected by mistake, ask Row-Bot to try again and review the next prompt.

# Workflows

Workflows are repeatable Row-Bot tasks. Use them for things you want to run again: a morning brief, inbox follow-up, document digest, research check, report draft, or channel delivery.

<Screenshot id="home-workflows" alt="Row-Bot Workflows tab." caption="The Workflows tab shows workflow cards, delivery defaults, run controls, and the New Workflow entry point." />

## Where To Find Workflows

Open Home -> Workflows. The Home tab is the dashboard; this page is the full guide.

## UI Walkthrough

- **Workflow list** shows saved workflows, status, next run, and quick actions.
- **New Workflow** opens the creation flow.
- **Delivery defaults** choose where results go unless a workflow overrides them.
- **Run** starts the selected workflow manually.
- **Pause/resume** controls whether scheduled runs continue.
- **Edit** opens the saved workflow for changes.
- **Delete** removes a workflow after confirmation.
- **Status labels** show whether a workflow is ready, paused, running, waiting for approval, or needs attention.

## Basic Workflow Creation

1. Click **New Workflow**.
2. Give the workflow a clear name.
3. Describe the task Row-Bot should perform.
4. Choose when it should run: manual, scheduled, or triggered when that option is available.
5. Choose delivery: app only, a channel, or another configured destination.
6. Save the workflow.
7. Run it manually once and review the result.

## Advanced Workflow Creation

Advanced workflows can include richer instructions, required inputs, model/profile choices, delivery overrides, approval rules, and multi-step behavior. Keep each step observable: what information Row-Bot should gather, what it should produce, where it should save or send output, and what requires your approval.

## What Is Saved

Workflow definitions, schedules, run history, delivery defaults, and status are local Row-Bot data. Results may be sent to channels only when configured and selected.

## Safety

Avoid workflows that send messages, write files, start servers, or call external systems without a review point. Use approvals for actions that can affect files, accounts, channels, MCP servers, plugins, or external services.

## Troubleshooting

- If a workflow does not run, check whether it is paused.
- If delivery fails, check the selected channel and its Settings tab.
- If a run waits for approval, decide from the thread prompt or open the Activity Center.
- If results are too broad, split the workflow into smaller steps.

# Designer Studio

Designer Studio helps you create visual work with Row-Bot: pages, slides, mockups, landing-page drafts, branded assets, charts, image or video inserts, and exportable design projects.

<Screenshot id="home-designer" alt="Row-Bot Designer entry point." caption="The Designer Home tab starts projects and opens the full Designer Studio workflow." />

## Where To Find It

Open Home -> Designer to start or reopen a project. The Home tab is the launcher. Designer Studio is the full workspace for editing, previewing, reviewing, and exporting.

## End-To-End Workflow

1. Start from a prompt, template, goal, or existing project.
2. Describe the audience, tone, length, and outcome.
3. Add reference files or brand details if they matter.
4. Create the project and review the first draft.
5. Use the editor and preview to inspect each page.
6. Ask Row-Bot to revise text, layout, media, charts, or brand details.
7. Review quality, export, or share a preview when ready.

## UI Walkthrough

- **Project gallery** lists recent saved projects.
- **New design flow** collects the goal, template, audience, tone, references, and brand.
- **Editor/canvas** shows the current page or screen.
- **Page navigator** moves through pages and lets you add, delete, reorder, or rename where available.
- **Control panels** expose brand, layout, import, export, share, review, and history actions.
- **Preview/output** lets you inspect the user-facing result before exporting.
- **Save/export** writes project state locally and creates files in the selected format.

## Brand And Assets

Designer can use saved brand presets, extract brand hints from a URL, accept reference uploads, and reuse project assets. Generated images or videos may call configured media providers; local-only design edits stay in local project data.

## Troubleshooting

- If a project starts empty, provide a more specific goal and audience.
- If exports look wrong, preview each page before exporting.
- If media generation is unavailable, check Providers and model capabilities.
- If a brand extraction fails, enter colors, fonts, or notes manually.

# Developer Studio

Developer Studio is Row-Bot's code workspace. Use it when you want Row-Bot to understand a local folder or Git repository, discuss code, inspect files, run approved commands, propose edits, and help review changes.

<Screenshot id="home-developer" alt="Row-Bot Developer entry point." caption="The Developer Home tab opens folders, connects repositories, clones projects, and starts Developer Studio workspaces." />

## Where To Find It

Open Home -> Developer. Choose an existing folder, connect a repository already on your machine, or clone a repository into a local workspace.

## End-To-End Workflow

1. Open or clone a project.
2. Confirm the workspace name, path, branch, and dirty state.
3. Ask Developer chat a code question or assign a change.
4. Review the inspector for files, detected commands, todos, context, and approvals.
5. Approve only the commands or edits you understand.
6. Run tests or checks.
7. Review the changed files before committing or exporting a patch.

## UI Walkthrough

- **Open folder** connects a local project without cloning.
- **Connect repository** uses a local Git checkout.
- **Clone repository** creates a new checkout from a remote URL.
- **Developer chat** is the conversation bound to that workspace.
- **Inspector** shows workspace identity, files, command suggestions, todos, changes, and run state.
- **File/context panel** helps Row-Bot and you see what code is relevant.
- **Command controls** run detected or requested commands through approval policy.
- **Change review** summarizes edits and lets you inspect before accepting next steps.

## Sandbox Modes

Local mode lets Row-Bot operate in the selected workspace with your configured file and command permissions. Docker sandbox mode, when available, isolates command execution in a container and requires an import step before changes affect the real workspace. Docker is safer for risky commands but requires Docker setup and can differ from your local environment.

For most users, start with local mode on a disposable branch. Use Docker when you want stronger isolation or are testing uncertain commands.

## Troubleshooting

- If Developer tools are unavailable, open a Developer workspace first.
- If commands are missing, inspect detected commands or ask Row-Bot to identify the project tooling.
- If a command asks for approval, read the exact command and workspace before approving.
- If Docker sandbox import is offered, review the patch before importing it into the real project.

## Common Workflow

1. Open Knowledge after a few useful chats or document imports.
2. Filter to the topic you care about.
3. Open a detail card.
4. Correct or remove misleading records.
5. Ask Chat to use knowledge only after you have verified important entries.

## What Is Saved

Knowledge records are local data. They can be used as context in future chats when memory, document search, or knowledge retrieval is enabled.

## Troubleshooting

- If Knowledge is empty, enable memory or index documents first.

## Logs And Journals

Recent logs help with immediate diagnosis. The knowledge extraction journal explains what Row-Bot extracted from conversations or documents. The dream journal explains background organization attempts. Use journals when you need a narrative of why a knowledge record or background status exists.

## Common Workflow

1. Reproduce or observe the issue.
2. Open Monitor and refresh.
3. Check status labels and recent logs.
4. Open the relevant journal.
5. Copy only non-sensitive details into a support request.

## What Is Saved

Logs and journals are local Row-Bot data. They may include file names, thread names, provider names, channel names, or task summaries, so review them before sharing.

## Troubleshooting

- If logs are empty, reproduce the issue and refresh.

Channels connect Row-Bot to external messaging platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, and SMS-style providers when configured. Use channels when you want to message Row-Bot outside the desktop app or send workflow results somewhere specific.

<Screenshot id="settings-channels" alt="Row-Bot Channels settings." caption="Channels settings show connector configuration, credentials, tunnel use, pairing, and start/stop controls." />

## Setup Workflow

1. Open Settings -> Channels.
2. Expand the channel you want.
3. Add the required token, URL, phone/account detail, or provider-specific field.
4. Configure a tunnel in Settings -> System if the channel requires an inbound webhook.
5. Save the channel.
6. Start the channel.
7. Pair or approve users before trusting private messages.
8. Test with a low-risk message.

## Controls

- **Save** stores channel settings.
- **Start** begins the channel runtime.
- **Stop** shuts the channel runtime down.
- **Tunnel controls** connect a channel to a public webhook URL when needed.
- **DM Pairing Code** approves a user before private-message access.
- **Paired Users** lists approved users and lets you revoke access.
- **Setup Guide** explains platform-specific prerequisites.

## Safety

Messages sent through a channel leave the local app. Do not enable a channel until you understand who can message it, what Row-Bot can send back, and whether workflows may deliver results there.

When work starts from a channel and a child agent asks for approval, Row-Bot sends the approval back to that parent channel conversation when the channel supports approval messages. The same approval remains visible in the desktop parent thread and Activity Center.

## Troubleshooting

- If a channel cannot start, check required fields and tunnel state.
- If inbound messages fail, verify webhook URLs and platform permissions.
- If the wrong person has access, revoke them from Paired Users.

# MCP

MCP lets Row-Bot use tools exposed by external Model Context Protocol servers. An MCP server can be local or remote, simple or powerful. Treat it like an extension with its own access and trust boundary.

<Screenshot id="settings-mcp" alt="Row-Bot MCP settings." caption="MCP settings manage global enablement, server rows, add/import/browse actions, tests, diagnostics, and per-server controls." />

3. Add, import, or browse for a server.
4. Review the command, arguments, URL, transport, and expected tools.
5. Save disabled first if you are unsure.
6. Test the server.
7. Enable the server only after you understand what it can access.

## Controls

- **Enable MCP** turns all external MCP tools on or off.
- **Add Server** opens the manual server form.
- **Import Config** imports server definitions from configuration text.
- **Browse MCP Servers** searches available server directories.
- **Diagnostics** helps explain connection failures.
- **Per-server enablement** decides whether a saved server contributes tools.
- **Test, refresh, edit, delete** manage the server row.

## Safety

MCP tools can read, write, call APIs, or automate services depending on the server. Row-Bot approvals still matter, but you should also trust the server itself before enabling it.

## Troubleshooting

- If a server fails to test, check transport, command, arguments, URL, and dependencies.
- If tools are missing, enable both the global MCP switch and the server.
- If a prompt asks for unexpected access, reject it and inspect the server configuration.

- **Enable/disable** controls whether plugin capabilities are active.
- **Configure** opens plugin-specific settings.
- **Update/remove** manage the local installation.
- **Marketplace** opens plugin discovery and install previews.
- **Custom Tools** can be promoted after review so they behave like reusable app capabilities.

## Safety

Plugins can add tools that read files, call services, or create outputs. Keep approval mode active for risky actions and disable plugins you do not actively use.

## Troubleshooting

- If a plugin does not load, inspect its manifest and dependency message.
- If plugin tools are missing, confirm the plugin is enabled.
- If a plugin causes errors, disable it, restart Row-Bot if needed, then review configuration.

# Skills Hub

Skills are instruction packs that teach Row-Bot how to approach a category of work. Skills Hub is where you browse installed skills, inspect details, enable or disable them, pin useful ones, and create or edit local skills.

<Screenshot id="settings-skills" alt="Row-Bot Skills settings and Skills Hub entry points." caption="Skills settings expose installed skills, browse/search entry points, enablement, and pinning controls." />

## UI Walkthrough

- **Browse/search** finds bundled, installed, local, and external-source skills.
- **Filters** narrow by source, installed state, or task type.
- **Skill detail** explains purpose, instructions, source, and status.
- **Enable/disable** decides whether Row-Bot may use the skill.
- **Pin** keeps an important skill easy to reach.
- **Create/edit** lets you maintain a local skill for your own workflow.

## Creating A Skill

1. Decide what task the skill should help with.
2. Write concise instructions, examples, and boundaries.
3. Include when the skill should and should not be used.
4. Save it locally.
5. Enable it and test with a small prompt.
6. Revise if Row-Bot overuses or misunderstands it.

## What Skills Change

Skills shape Row-Bot's behavior; they do not automatically grant credentials or bypass approvals. A skill can make Row-Bot more consistent for a task, but tools still need to be enabled and approved where appropriate.

## Troubleshooting

- If a skill is not used, make your prompt match its purpose and confirm it is enabled.
- If a skill is too aggressive, disable or rewrite it with clearer boundaries.
- If an external skill is unfamiliar, inspect it before enabling.

# Voice And Buddy

Voice and Buddy make Row-Bot feel less like a text box and more like a desktop companion. Voice handles speech input and optional spoken output. Buddy is the visual companion that reflects app state and can live in the sidebar, workspace, or desktop overlay.

<Screenshot id="settings-voice" alt="Row-Bot Voice settings." caption="Voice settings control Dictate, Talk, read-aloud, voice models, devices, and diagnostics." />

## Voice Modes

- **Dictate** turns speech into composer text so you can review it before sending.
- **Talk** submits spoken input more directly for conversation.
- **Read-aloud** speaks assistant responses when enabled.
- **Local voice** uses local speech components where available.
- **Realtime voice** uses a compatible provider for lower-latency spoken conversation.

## Choosing A Mode

Use Dictate when accuracy and review matter. Use Talk when you want a faster hands-light conversation. Use local voice when privacy and offline-style behavior matter. Use realtime voice when latency matters and you accept internet access, provider requirements, and provider cost.

## Devices And Diagnostics

Select the microphone and output device in Settings -> Voice. Run diagnostics when audio is silent, delayed, or routed to the wrong device.

<Screenshot id="settings-buddy" alt="Row-Bot Buddy settings." caption="Buddy settings control companion visibility, overlay, personality, look, motion, and optional custom-look generation." />

## Buddy Controls

- **Enable switches** choose sidebar, workspace, or desktop overlay visibility.
- **Open and close overlay** manage the separate desktop companion window.
- **Companion personality** changes the tone of Buddy cues.
- **Bubble style** changes status presentation.
- **Look cards** choose bundled or custom appearances.
- **Generate full Buddy**, **Retry motion**, and **Use still only** manage custom looks.

## Privacy And Safety

Voice input can become chat text. Realtime voice and provider-backed speech may send audio or transcript data to the selected provider. Buddy preferences and assets are local, but custom generation may call a configured media provider.

## Troubleshooting

- If Dictate records nothing, check microphone selection and permissions.
- If Talk sends too quickly, use Dictate instead.
- If realtime voice is unavailable, check Providers and Voice Models.
- If Buddy does not appear, check Buddy enable switches and overlay state.

        """
# Privacy And Safety

Row-Bot is local-first: the app and its data live on your machine. Local-first does not mean every feature is offline. Hosted models, web search, browser actions, account tools, channels, MCP servers, plugins, realtime voice, and media providers can send data outside the app when you configure and use them.

## Local Data

Conversations, memories, documents, workflows, logs, Designer projects, Developer workspaces, skills, plugins, Buddy assets, and settings are stored in the active local Row-Bot data directory.

## External Calls

External calls happen when you choose or enable something that needs them: hosted models, subscription providers, API providers, web search, browser automation, account tools, messaging channels, MCP servers, plugin tools, realtime voice, and media generation.

## Credentials

Enter credentials only in the relevant Settings tab or provider sign-in flow. Row-Bot stores secrets in the operating system key store when available and keeps local metadata for status and diagnostics.

## Approvals

Use approvals to review file writes, command execution, browser actions, account actions, channel sends, MCP calls, plugin tools, Developer changes, and other sensitive actions. Reject anything that does not match your request.

Approval mode is policy, not a model choice: blocked actions stay blocked, ask-mode actions wait for you, and auto-approved actions follow the configured policy. Some prompts include a short model-written reason for readability, but the underlying approval gate and action details are system-controlled.

## Sharing Logs Or Screenshots

Before sharing logs, screenshots, documents, thread exports, or review packages, check for names, file paths, account names, message contents, tokens, private documents, or misleading real data.

## Safer Defaults

- Start with local models when privacy matters most.
- Keep channels, MCP, and plugins disabled until needed.
- Use narrow workspaces for file tools.
- Review approvals before external or destructive actions.
- Keep a final human review step before publishing screenshots or docs built from a personal app state.

        """
# Troubleshooting

Start with the visible status text in Row-Bot. Then check the relevant Settings tab and Monitor. Most issues fall into one of four categories: setup is incomplete, a provider or tool is disabled, the wrong model is selected, or Row-Bot is waiting for approval.

## Setup Problems

- Reopen Setup Center if first launch was skipped or incomplete.
- Check Settings -> Providers and Settings -> Models before troubleshooting Chat.
- Check Settings -> System if local files, browser automation, command execution, or tunnels are involved.

## Model Problems

- Refresh Providers, then refresh Models.
- Choose a tool-capable model for workflows, Designer, Developer, and multi-step tool use.
- For local and custom endpoints, use enough context for Row-Bot's instructions and tool schemas.

## Chat And Tool Problems

- Check the model picker, Agent Profile, approval mode, and enabled tools.
- If an action is waiting, review the thread approval prompt or open Activity Center.
- Ask Row-Bot to explain the last tool result if the transcript is unclear.

## Workflow Problems

- Confirm the workflow is not paused.
- Run it manually once before trusting a schedule.
- Check delivery defaults and channel status.

## Designer And Developer Problems

- Designer: add a clearer goal, audience, references, or brand details.
- Developer: confirm a workspace is open before asking for code actions.
- Review commands and patches before approving or importing changes.

## Knowledge And Monitor Problems

- If Knowledge is empty, enable memory or index documents.
- If a record is wrong, edit or remove it.
- Use Monitor logs, extraction journal, dream journal, and View Full Log for background issues.

## Integrations

- Channels need credentials, optional tunnel setup, start/stop state, and user pairing.
- MCP needs the global switch, a trusted server, and a successful test.
- Plugins need installation, enablement, configuration, and sometimes a restart.
- Skills need to be enabled and relevant to the prompt.

## Voice And Buddy

- Check microphone/output device selection and permissions.
- Use Dictate before Talk if you need review.
- Check provider readiness for realtime voice.
- Toggle Buddy visibility or reopen the overlay if the companion is missing.

# Models And Providers

Providers are where models come from. Models are the specific choices you use in Chat, workflows, Designer, Developer, voice, and other Row-Bot surfaces.

## Recommended Setup Order

1. Open Settings -> Providers.
2. Connect one provider path.
3. Refresh provider health.
4. Open Settings -> Models.
5. Refresh the catalog.
6. Choose a default model.
7. Pin Quick Choices.
8. Test in Chat.

## Choosing A Provider Path

Use local Ollama for local-first privacy and no provider billing. Use an API provider for strong hosted models. Use a subscription account when you already have the supported provider account. Use a custom endpoint for advanced local or self-hosted OpenAI-compatible runtimes.

## Choosing Models

Keep at least one everyday chat model and one stronger tool-capable model pinned. For Developer, Designer, workflows, and complex tools, choose a model that can handle tool calls and enough context.

## Troubleshooting

- If a provider connects but has no models, refresh Models.
- If a model fails with tools, choose a tool-capable model.
- If a custom endpoint fails, check base URL, model name, API compatibility, and context window.
