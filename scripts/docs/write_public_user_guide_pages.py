# Row-Bot Documentation

Row-Bot is a local-first AI workbench for people who want provider-aware models, parent-led agents, durable documents, memory, tools, workflows, design, code help, integrations, and voice in one controllable system. Run it as a desktop application or a private authenticated server; this guide explains installation, Docker deployment, owner access, the main interface, settings, and every explicit external route.

These pages describe Row-Bot 4.9.1, the release represented by this source tree.

<Screenshot id="home-knowledge" alt="Row-Bot desktop workspace showing the Knowledge graph, conversations, tools, workflows, channels, Activity Center, and terminal." caption="The Knowledge workspace brings Row-Bot's local graph together with conversations, tools, workflows, channels, activity, approvals, and terminal output." />

# Getting Started

Start here if you are new to Row-Bot. You only need three things for a useful first session: the app installed, one working model path, and a basic understanding of where Row-Bot stores local data.

## The Short Path

1. Install Row-Bot from the release package for your platform.
2. Launch the app and complete the first-run wizard.
3. Choose one model path: local Ollama, a hosted provider, a subscription account, or a custom endpoint.
4. Send a first chat message.
5. Open Settings later when you are ready for documents, workflows, Designer, Developer, channels, MCP, plugins, Skills, Buddy, or voice.

## Important Concepts

- **Local app** means Row-Bot runs on your machine and opens a local desktop or browser window.
- **Data directory** means the folder where Row-Bot keeps conversations, memories, documents, settings, workflows, logs, Designer projects, Developer workspaces, skills, plugins, and local integration state.
- **Model provider** means the service or local runtime that supplies a model. Ollama is local; API and subscription providers usually use the internet.
- **Tools** are actions Row-Bot can take, such as reading files, searching documents, using a browser, running Developer commands, or sending through a channel.
- **Approvals** are prompts that ask you to review sensitive actions before Row-Bot proceeds.

For ordinary use, install Row-Bot from the latest release package for your operating system. Running from source is useful for contributors, testers, and people who want to inspect or modify the app.

## Install From A Release

1. Download the latest Row-Bot release for Windows, macOS, or Linux.
2. Run the installer or unpack the archive.
3. Launch Row-Bot from the Start Menu, Applications, app launcher, or the provided command.
4. Let the first-run wizard open and choose a model path.

The installed app starts a local Row-Bot process and opens the UI in a desktop window or browser, depending on your platform and launch preference. If the usual port is busy, Row-Bot chooses another local port.

## Run From Source

Use the source path if you are developing Row-Bot or testing changes:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a Python environment.
3. Install uv and sync the locked Python dependencies with `uv sync --locked --all-extras --group test`.
4. Install the docs-site dependencies only if you are working on documentation.
5. Run the app entry point from the repository.

`requirements.txt` is a generated pip export from `uv.lock` for installer compatibility. It is available as a fallback for environments that cannot use uv, but source dependency changes should be made in `pyproject.toml`.

Source runs use the same local data concepts as the packaged app. Keep test data separate from personal data when experimenting.

## Local Data Directory

Row-Bot stores local app data under the active Row-Bot data directory. This includes conversations, memories, model/provider metadata, workflows, Designer projects, Developer workspace records, documents, logs, skills, plugins, Buddy assets, channel settings, and MCP settings.

Advanced users can set `ROW_BOT_DATA_DIR` before launch to use a separate data directory for testing or portable runs. Do this before starting the app, and remember that Row-Bot will treat that folder as the active local data store for the whole process.

## After Installing

Continue to [First Launch](/docs/getting-started/first-launch). You can finish optional setup later from the Setup Center and Settings.

The standard desktop install stays on local loopback. To connect another trusted computer or phone, finish local setup first and then follow [Remote Access And Server Mode](/docs/operations/remote-access). For a headless or container deployment, read that guide before publishing a port or creating the first owner invitation.

# First Launch

The first-run wizard appears until setup is complete. Its job is to help you connect one working model path so Row-Bot can answer a first chat message. Everything else can be configured later.

<Screenshot id="first-launch-setup-wizard" alt="Row-Bot first launch setup wizard." caption="The first-run wizard helps you choose a local, hosted, subscription, or custom model path before optional setup begins." />

## Choose A Model Path

A model is the AI system that writes responses and reasons through tasks. Row-Bot can work with several kinds of model providers:

| Path | Good For | Tradeoffs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local Ollama | Privacy-focused local chats and tool use when your machine has enough resources. | Requires installing models locally. Larger models need more memory and disk space. |
| Hosted API provider | Strong models without local downloads. | Requires an API key, internet access, and provider billing. Prompt content can be sent to that provider. |
| Subscription account | Using a supported account-backed provider from inside Row-Bot. | Requires sign-in or token import and follows that provider's account terms. |
| Custom endpoint | Advanced local or self-hosted runtimes such as LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp, LocalAI, LiteLLM, or SGLang. | Requires endpoint details and compatible model behavior. Tool use needs enough context and function-calling support. |

For beginners, start with the provider path you already trust. If you are unsure, Ollama is the simplest local-first path, while an API provider is usually the quickest path to strong hosted models.

## Install Private Knowledge Search

Every normal desktop, source, and official Docker install uses the same setup step. The wizard offers **Mixedbread Embed Large v1**, a separate local model for semantic memory and document search, as a checked-by-default 675 MB download. It is not the model that writes chat responses.

The download starts when you finish setup and requires internet access to Hugging Face. Files go into Row-Bot's private cache; documents and memories are not uploaded, and normal recall stays offline after the initial download. Docker keeps this cache in its named `/data` volume.

You can uncheck the option and finish without it. Row-Bot continues with bounded lexical and graph fallback, so chat and memory do not stop working. Later, open [Settings → Documents](/docs/settings/documents) and use **Download model**. **Retry local load** retries an already cached model; **Repair local model** deliberately replaces a damaged download. Rebuild the document and memory vectors after changing the embedding provider or model.

<Screenshot id="settings-documents" alt="Row-Bot Documents settings showing the Mixedbread local embedding model and download, retry, repair, and vector rebuild controls." caption="Settings → Documents shows whether the local embedding model is ready and provides explicit download, retry, repair, and index rebuild actions." />

## Setup Center

<Screenshot id="setup-center" alt="Row-Bot Setup Center." caption="Setup Center lets you finish optional setup areas later without blocking the first chat." />

Setup Center is the place to finish or revisit optional setup after the first launch. It can guide you through models, documents, workflows, Designer, Developer, channels, accounts, MCP, plugins, Buddy, and voice. The wizard gets you started; Setup Center helps you build out the rest of your app over time.

## Privacy, Cost, And Credentials

Local model runs can stay on your machine. Hosted, subscription, realtime voice, web search, account, channel, MCP, and plugin features can contact outside services when configured and used. Provider keys and account tokens should be entered only through the relevant Settings or account flow. Cost depends on the provider or service you choose.

## Troubleshooting

- If the wizard cannot find a local model, start Ollama and install a model first.
- If a hosted provider connects but no models appear, refresh Providers and Models.
- If the private knowledge model download fails, check internet access to Hugging Face and try finishing setup again, or uncheck it and install it later from Settings → Documents.
- If you skip optional setup, open Setup Center or Settings later.

        """
# Row-Bot Interface

The Row-Bot Interface is the main workspace you see after launch. It combines conversations, Home tabs, status panels, approvals, workflows, Buddy, Settings, and terminal output in one local app window.

<Screenshot id="app-shell-overview" alt="Row-Bot main interface." caption="The main interface shows the left sidebar, Home tabs, central work area, Activity Center, Buddy, Settings, and terminal." />

## Left Sidebar

- **Home** returns to the Home tabs: Workflows, Designer, Developer, Knowledge, and Monitor.
- **New** starts a fresh conversation thread.
- **Conversations** shows recent threads. The sidebar keeps the list short so the workspace stays usable; use **Show all** when you need older threads.
- **Thread menu** on a conversation row opens actions such as rename and delete.
- **Rename** changes the visible thread title without changing the messages.
- **Delete** stops work owned by the conversation and removes its Row-Bot-managed messages, sessions, media, drafts, tool history, workflow state, and related Agent state after confirmation. Developer worktrees or sandboxes with unimported changes are retained and reported instead of being discarded.
- **Agent profiles** opens the profile selector and profile management area.
- **Buddy** appears near the bottom when enabled. In the native Windows and macOS apps, drag Buddy itself away from the sidebar to undock its compact thread overlay.
- **Settings** opens the full configuration dialog.

## Show All Threads

When you have more threads than the sidebar shows, use **Show all** from the conversations area. The dialog groups user-managed conversations into **All**, **Chat**, **Design**, **Code**, and **Workflow** filters. Agent child threads remain owned by their parent run and do not appear as independent cleanup targets.

Use **Select** to enter selection mode. Check individual rows, or use **Select all** to select only the conversations in the current filter; switch filters to add other conversations without losing the existing selection. **Clear all** affects the current filter, while the action bar's **Clear** resets the whole selection. The destructive action reports the exact selected count and always asks for confirmation.

**Delete all** also respects the current filter. Deletion stops active generation, Agent, workflow, shell, browser, and Computer Use work for each target before removing Row-Bot-managed state. The progress dialog keeps the cleanup off the interface event loop. If a Developer worktree contains changes or a sandbox has unimported work, Row-Bot keeps it and reports that recovery path instead of silently deleting it. This cleanup cannot be undone, so export anything you still need first.

Start a new thread when the task has a new goal; continue an existing thread when the earlier context still matters.

## Buddy Desktop Overlay

The undocked Buddy follows the thread selected in Row-Bot and shows its name, Chat/Developer/Designer context, current response, and approval state. You can send text, stop the active response, handle simple approvals, or open the full thread for complete details. The overlay menu also collapses, hides, or docks Buddy. Read [Settings: Buddy](/docs/settings/buddy) for the complete user workflow.

## Home Tabs

The central Home area has five tabs:

- **Workflows** for saved automations and background agents.
- **Designer** for starting design projects.
- **Developer** for opening code workspaces and Custom Tools.
- **Knowledge** for memory, document, and graph review.
- **Monitor** for logs, journals, channel state, and background activity.

Home pages in these docs are short entry-point pages. The dedicated feature pages are the full guides.

## Activity Center And Right Drawer

The right side summarizes what needs attention:

- **Current goals and agents** shows running or waiting goal-mode and child-agent activity.
- **Approvals** shows pending approval prompts from chats, child agents, and background work.
- **Workflows** shows active and upcoming workflow state, plus run and new controls.
- **Launch** lets you choose a workflow and run it manually.
- **Insights** expands supporting status and suggestions when available.

Use the Activity Center when you want to know whether Row-Bot is idle, waiting for you, running background work, or ready to launch a workflow. Child-agent approvals also appear in the parent thread so you can decide without leaving the conversation.

## Terminal Panel

The terminal panel at the bottom shows command-oriented output when a tool, Developer workspace, or local runtime exposes it through the UI. It is not a general replacement for your system terminal. Command execution still follows Row-Bot's active tool availability, workspace boundaries, and approval mode.

## Agent Profiles

Agent profiles change how Row-Bot behaves for a thread or specialist run. The sidebar profile control opens the profile selector; the detailed walkthrough is in [Agent Profiles](/docs/app-shell/agent-profiles).

## What Is Saved

Threads, thread names, selected models, profile choices, workflow records, knowledge records, settings, and logs are saved in the local Row-Bot data directory. Some choices are thread-specific; Settings usually changes global app behavior.

## Troubleshooting

- If a thread is missing from the sidebar, open Show All and search.
- If a panel looks stale, use the visible refresh control or reload the app.
- If a button is disabled, check the related Settings tab and Monitor for readiness messages.

        """
# Agent Profiles

Agent Profiles are presets for how Row-Bot should act. A profile can change tone, tool availability, skill hints, approval posture, and specialist behavior. Use them when the same app needs to behave differently for research, coding, planning, design, or careful local-only work.

## Where To Find Profiles

Open the **Agent profiles** area in the left sidebar, or use the profile control in a chat header when it is visible. The dialog lets you choose a profile for the current thread and inspect available built-in profiles.

## What The Profile Dialog Does

- **Profile list** shows available built-in and local profiles.
- **Selected profile** is the behavior Row-Bot will use for the current thread or new specialist run.
- **Description** explains what the profile is optimized for.
- **Tools and skills** indicate which capabilities the profile may prefer or restrict.
- **Default behavior** explains whether the profile is meant for general chat, Agent Mode, Developer work, Designer work, or controlled tasks.
- **Save or apply** records the choice for the current thread when the dialog offers it.

## Practical Examples

- Use a research-style profile for web and document synthesis.
- Use a coding profile inside Developer Studio so Row-Bot pays attention to files, commands, tests, and change review.
- Use a cautious profile when you want more approvals and less external activity.
- Use a design profile when you are working in Designer Studio and want visual output iteration.

## What Is Saved

Profile selection can be saved on a thread, so future turns keep the same behavior. Built-in profile definitions are part of Row-Bot; local custom profiles are stored in local app data when supported.

## Privacy And Safety

A profile can influence which tools Row-Bot prefers, but it does not bypass approvals. If a profile enables broader tool use, review approval prompts before allowing file writes, browser actions, shell commands, account actions, MCP calls, plugin tools, or channel sends.

## Troubleshooting

- If Row-Bot behaves too narrowly, switch back to a general profile.
- If a tool is unavailable, check both the profile and the related Settings tab.
- If a profile choice does not stick, confirm you applied it to the active thread.

# Chat

Chat is the main place to ask Row-Bot for help. A chat thread can stay simple, or it can use models, memory, documents, tools, approvals, attachments, skills, voice, workflows, and specialist profiles.

<Screenshot id="chat-main" alt="Row-Bot chat view with conversation and composer controls." caption="The chat view shows the active conversation, model context, tool-result history, and message composer controls." />

## UI Walkthrough

- **Thread header** shows the current thread title and actions such as rename, profile selection, model state, and export when available.
- **Transcript** contains user messages, assistant responses, tool results, charts, images, reasoning sections, and status messages.
- **Composer** is where you type the next request. Use plain language and include the outcome you want.
- **Send** submits the composer text to the selected model.
- **Stop** appears while Row-Bot is responding and asks the current run to stop.
- **Regenerate or retry controls** appear when a response can be run again.
- **Model picker** chooses the model for this thread. See [Model Picker](/docs/chat/model-picker).
- **Thinking control** appears beside the model only when that exact model exposes supported reasoning choices. See [Reasoning Controls](/docs/chat/reasoning-controls).
- **Approval mode** controls how sensitive actions are reviewed for this thread.
- **Attachments and context controls** add files or local context to the current request.
- **Skills and slash commands** help start structured tasks when available. Enabled skills can also be selected progressively for the current task.
- **Voice buttons** use Dictate or Talk when voice is configured.
- **Tool traces** show what tools Row-Bot used and what came back.
- **Approval prompts** pause gated actions until you approve or reject them. When a child agent needs approval, the prompt appears in the parent thread too.

## Beginner Workflow

1. Start a new thread.
2. Choose a model that is ready for chat.
3. Ask one clear question or task.
4. Attach files only when the task needs them.
5. Review any approval prompt before allowing Row-Bot to act.
6. Rename the thread when it becomes useful enough to keep.

## Power Workflow

1. Choose an Agent Profile for the kind of work.
2. Pick a stronger tool-capable model.
3. Attach documents or enable retrieval only for relevant context.
4. Let Row-Bot use tools, but approve file writes, browser actions, shell commands, account actions, channel sends, MCP calls, and plugin tools deliberately.
5. Export or continue the thread after the work is complete.

## Continue From The Buddy Overlay

In the native Windows and macOS apps, drag Buddy from the sidebar onto the desktop for a compact view of the selected thread. Its composer shares that thread's saved draft, model, tools, approval mode, and active response. Simple approvals can appear in the overlay; open the full thread for complex approvals, attachments, transcript history, tool traces, model controls, Talk, or Dictate. See [Settings: Buddy](/docs/settings/buddy).

## Manage Conversation History

Open **Show all** from the conversation sidebar to filter Chat, Design, Code, or Workflow conversations. Choose **Select** for checkbox-based cleanup, then select individual conversations or use **Select all** for the current filter. The action bar shows the exact cross-filter selection count before you confirm deletion. **Delete all** applies only to the currently visible filter.

Deleting a conversation stops its active work and removes its Row-Bot-managed messages, drafts, attachments, media, tool sessions, workflow state, and Agent state. A linked Designer project is detached from the deleted conversation. Developer worktrees with changes and sandboxes with unimported work are kept and reported so deletion does not discard source work. Export anything you need before confirming because conversation deletion cannot be undone.

## What Is Saved

Thread names, messages, selected model overrides, per-model reasoning selections, approval mode, profile selection, attachments copied into Row-Bot-managed storage, and tool results are saved locally. Some external providers may receive prompt content when you choose their models.

## Privacy And Safety

Local model runs can stay on your machine. Hosted models, web search, browser actions, account tools, MCP servers, plugins, and channels can send data outside the app when configured and used. Row-Bot should not insert secrets into chat; enter credentials only through Settings or the provider's sign-in flow.

## Troubleshooting

- If Row-Bot cannot answer with the current model, choose a more capable model in the picker.
- If the Thinking control is missing or a saved choice resets, read [Reasoning Controls](/docs/chat/reasoning-controls#troubleshooting).
- If attachments are ignored, confirm the files finished uploading and are relevant to the prompt.
- If a tool is unavailable, check Settings, the current Agent Profile, and approval mode.
- If an external tool is enabled but not selected automatically, use a more specific request or review [Progressive Tools And Skills](/docs/guides/progressive-tools-and-skills).
- If a run is stuck, press Stop, then retry with a narrower prompt.

        """
# Model Picker

The Model Picker chooses which model powers the current chat thread. It is where provider setup becomes visible in day-to-day use.

## Where Models Come From

Models appear after Row-Bot discovers them from a connected provider or local runtime:

- Local Ollama models come from the Ollama service running on your machine.
- API provider models come from a provider connected in Settings -> Providers.
- Subscription models come from a supported account-backed provider after sign-in or token import.
- Custom endpoint models come from the compatible endpoint details you provide.
- Pinned Quick Choices come from Settings -> Models and are shown first for convenience.

## UI Walkthrough

- **Pinned models** are your quick picks for everyday use.
- **Provider groups** keep local, API, subscription, and custom endpoint models understandable.
- **Search** narrows long model lists.
- **Capability labels** help distinguish chat, tool-capable, vision, reasoning, embedding, media, and voice models.
- **Disabled or missing providers** stay out of normal selection until they are configured and healthy.
- **Thread override** means the selected model applies to the active thread without changing your global default.

## Choosing Well

Use a smaller or local model for quick private chats. Use a stronger tool-capable model for workflows, Developer Studio, Designer Studio, long context, or multi-step tool use. For local and self-hosted endpoints, prefer a context window large enough for Row-Bot's instructions and tool schemas.

Reasoning choices belong to the exact provider-qualified model, not just its display name. After choosing a supported model, use the conditional Thinking control described in [Reasoning Controls](/docs/chat/reasoning-controls).

## Pinning Models

Open Settings -> Models, refresh the catalog, and pin the models you use often. Pinning does not create a new model; it just puts an existing discovered model into your Quick Choices.

## Troubleshooting

- If a model is missing, refresh Providers, then refresh Models.
- If a provider is connected but disabled, review the provider row message.
- If a model appears but fails with tools, choose a model labeled or tested for Agent Mode.
- If custom endpoint models look duplicated, use the provider-qualified name.

    write(
        "chat/reasoning-controls.mdx",
        "Reasoning Controls",
        "Choose provider-aware reasoning effort, thinking toggles, and token budgets for the active Row-Bot model.",
        """
# Reasoning Controls

Reasoning controls let you change how much supported models reason before answering without switching models. Row-Bot shows only choices that the exact provider-qualified model reports or that Row-Bot can identify from a maintained model route.

## Where To Find The Control

- In desktop Chat, Designer Studio, and Developer Studio, the **Thinking** control sits beside the model picker in the composer. On narrow desktop windows, the composer progressively compacts labels while keeping each icon paired with its own menu.
- In the compact mobile layout, open **Chat controls**. Reasoning appears below Model when the selected model supports it.
- In Chat or a connected messaging channel, use `/reasoning` to inspect the current choice and the valid choices for the active model.

The control is intentionally absent when Row-Bot does not have exact, actionable reasoning capability data for the selected model. A generic model name or a provider-wide assumption is not enough.

## What The Choices Mean

| Choice | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Provider default | Sends no per-thread reasoning override and lets the provider or endpoint choose its normal behavior. This is the safest compatibility choice. |
| Low, Medium, High, XHigh, or another effort | Requests one of the exact effort levels supported by the selected model. The list varies by model. |
| On or Off | Enables or disables thinking only when that model exposes a true toggle. Models with mandatory reasoning do not offer Off. |
| Token budget | Sets a positive reasoning-token budget within the minimum and maximum reported for that model. This appears only for budget-capable models. |

More reasoning can increase latency and provider token usage. It can help with planning, coding, analysis, and multi-step tool use, but a higher setting is not automatically better for every request.

## Scope And Persistence

A selection is saved locally for one thread and one exact provider-qualified model. Switching models does not apply an incompatible value to the new model. If you return to a model in the same thread, Row-Bot can restore that model's valid saved choice.

Changing the global default model does not rewrite existing thread choices. Designer Studio and Developer Studio use the same thread-scoped behavior as normal Chat.

## Slash And Channel Commands

Run `/reasoning` with no argument to show the active setting and valid choices. Supported examples include:

```text
/reasoning high
/reasoning default
/reasoning on
/reasoning off
/reasoning budget 4096
```

Row-Bot validates the command against the active model. Unsupported efforts, toggles, or budgets are rejected without replacing the previous valid selection. Messaging channels use their conversation's active thread and model, so the setting remains isolated from unrelated chats.

## Providers And Custom Endpoints

Row-Bot maps native reasoning controls for supported OpenAI and Codex, Anthropic and Claude Subscription, xAI, Google, Ollama and Ollama Cloud, OpenRouter, and compatible endpoint routes when exact capability data is available. Available models and choices can change as provider catalogs change; the control itself is the authoritative list for the selected model.

For a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint, open **Settings -> Providers**, edit or add the endpoint, then expand **Advanced -> Reasoning**. Keep **Reasoning mode** on Auto unless the endpoint's metadata is missing or wrong. Thinking budget, returned reasoning content, replay, and extra request JSON are advanced compatibility settings that apply to every model exposed by that endpoint. Enable replay only when the endpoint explicitly supports receiving preserved reasoning history.

## Responses And Compatibility Fallback

When a provider returns reasoning content, Row-Bot can stream it separately and retain it as a collapsed **Thinking** section instead of mixing it into the final answer.

If a provider rejects a valid-looking explicit reasoning choice before returning response content, Row-Bot retries once with Provider default, clears the rejected saved override, and shows a notice. Authentication failures, rate limits, timeouts, cancellations, and server failures are not silently retried as reasoning compatibility problems.

## Privacy And Safety

The selected control is stored locally with thread settings, but hosted providers receive the resulting reasoning parameter and may bill for additional tokens. Reasoning content returned by a provider can contain sensitive intermediate material. Do not enable reasoning replay for a custom endpoint unless you trust that endpoint and understand its message format.

## Troubleshooting

- **The control is missing:** confirm the active model is provider-qualified, refresh Providers and Models, and check that its catalog entry exposes exact reasoning capabilities.
- **A choice disappeared after switching models:** choices are model-specific; inspect the new model's menu or run `/reasoning`.
- **A saved choice reset to Provider default:** the provider rejected it or refreshed capability metadata no longer supports it. Read the notice, refresh the catalog, and choose from the current list.
- **A custom endpoint returns reasoning in the wrong place:** review its Advanced Reasoning settings, especially returned reasoning content and replay. Keep replay off unless required.
- **High reasoning is slow or expensive:** choose a lower supported effort, a smaller budget, or Provider default.

# Tools, Approvals, And Terminal

Tools are actions Row-Bot can take beyond writing text. They can search documents, read files, use a browser, run Developer commands, create designs, inspect knowledge, call MCP servers, use plugins, or send through channels.

## How Tool Use Appears

When Row-Bot uses a tool, the transcript can show a tool trace or result block. Read it as an activity receipt: what Row-Bot tried, what came back, and whether more action is needed.

## Approval Prompts

Approval prompts appear when an action can change local files, run commands, contact external systems, use accounts, start servers, send messages, call MCP/plugin tools, or do something else that deserves review.

If a child agent needs approval, Row-Bot posts a compact approval prompt in the parent thread, keeps the desktop Activity Center in sync, and routes channel-started work back to the originating channel when possible. The prompt may include a short model-written reason, but Row-Bot's approval policy still decides whether the action is blocked, allowed, or waiting for you.

Before approving, check:

- What action is being requested.
- What file, workspace, account, channel, server, or provider is involved.
- Whether the action can send data outside the app.
- Whether the proposed command or file change matches your request.
- Whether rejecting is safer until you inspect settings.

Approving lets Row-Bot continue that action. Rejecting stops that action and returns control to the conversation. On small screens and in channels, prompts stay brief; open the thread or Activity Center when you need more context.

## Terminal Output

The terminal panel shows command-style output when Row-Bot surfaces it from local tools, Developer Studio, or related runtime activity. It is a review surface, not permission by itself. Commands still follow workspace boundaries, tool availability, and approval mode.

## Common Workflow

1. Ask for a task that may need tools.
2. Let Row-Bot explain the intended action.
3. Review the approval prompt.
4. Approve only if the action matches your intent.
5. Inspect the tool trace or terminal output.
6. Ask Row-Bot to summarize what changed.

## Troubleshooting

- If no approval appears, the action may be read-only or blocked before execution.
- If a tool result is confusing, ask Row-Bot to explain the last tool call.
- If command output is missing, check whether you are in Developer Studio or a tool-capable context.
- If you rejected by mistake, ask Row-Bot to try again and review the next prompt.

- **Pause/resume** controls whether scheduled runs continue.
- **Edit** opens the saved workflow for changes.
- **Delete** removes a workflow after confirmation.
- **Status labels** show whether a workflow is ready, paused, running, waiting for approval, or needs attention.

## Basic Workflow Creation

1. Click **New Workflow**.
2. Give the workflow a clear name.
3. Describe the task Row-Bot should perform.
4. Choose when it should run: manual, scheduled, or triggered when that option is available.
5. Choose delivery: app only, a channel, or another configured destination.
6. Save the workflow.
7. Run it manually once and review the result.

## Advanced Workflow Creation

Advanced workflows can include richer instructions, required inputs, model/profile choices, delivery overrides, approval rules, and multi-step behavior. Keep each step observable: what information Row-Bot should gather, what it should produce, where it should save or send output, and what requires your approval.

## What Is Saved

Workflow definitions, schedules, run history, delivery defaults, and status are local Row-Bot data. Results may be sent to channels only when configured and selected.

## Safety

Avoid workflows that send messages, write files, start servers, or call external systems without a review point. Use approvals for actions that can affect files, accounts, channels, MCP servers, plugins, or external services.

## Troubleshooting

- If a workflow does not run, check whether it is paused.
- If delivery fails, check the selected channel and its Settings tab.
- If a run waits for approval, decide from the thread prompt or open the Activity Center.
- If results are too broad, split the workflow into smaller steps.

# Designer Studio

Designer Studio helps you create visual work with Row-Bot: pages, slides, mockups, landing-page drafts, branded assets, charts, image or video inserts, and exportable design projects.

<Screenshot id="home-designer" alt="Row-Bot Designer entry point." caption="The Designer Home tab starts projects and opens the full Designer Studio workflow." />

<Screenshot id="designer-editor" alt="Row-Bot Designer Studio editor with a fictional workshop presentation." caption="The full Designer editor combines project chat, page navigation, the live preview, brand and asset controls, and export entry points." />

## Where To Find It

Open Home -> Designer to start or reopen a project. The Home tab is the launcher. Designer Studio is the full workspace for editing, previewing, reviewing, and exporting.

## End-To-End Workflow

1. Start from a prompt, template, goal, or existing project.
2. Describe the audience, tone, length, and outcome.
3. Add reference files or brand details if they matter.
4. Create the project and review the first draft.
5. Use the editor and preview to inspect each page.
6. Ask Row-Bot to revise text, layout, media, charts, or brand details.
7. Review quality, export, or share a preview when ready.

## UI Walkthrough

- **Project gallery** lists recent saved projects.
- **New design flow** collects the goal, template, audience, tone, references, and brand.
- **Editor/canvas** shows the current page or screen.
- **Page navigator** moves through pages and lets you add, delete, reorder, or rename where available.
- **Control panels** expose brand, layout, import, export, share, review, and history actions.
- **Preview/output** lets you inspect the user-facing result before exporting.
- **Save/export** writes project state locally and creates files in the selected format.

## Brand And Assets

Designer can use saved brand presets, extract brand hints from a URL, accept reference uploads, and reuse project assets. Generated images or videos may call configured media providers; local-only design edits stay in local project data.

For xAI API image models, Row-Bot uses the provider's live image-generation catalog instead of guessing from the chat catalog. It exposes only the formats, aspect ratios, resolutions, and quality choices reported for that model. If xAI rejects an optional quality field, Row-Bot retries once without it; timeouts and other failures do not trigger an automatic second generation that could duplicate cost.

## Troubleshooting

- If a project starts empty, provide a more specific goal and audience.
- If exports look wrong, preview each page before exporting.
- If media generation is unavailable, check Providers and model capabilities.
- If a brand extraction fails, enter colors, fonts, or notes manually.

        """
# Developer Studio

Developer Studio is Row-Bot's code workspace. Use it when you want Row-Bot to understand a local folder or Git repository, discuss code, inspect files, run approved commands, propose edits, and help review changes.

<Screenshot id="home-developer" alt="Row-Bot Developer entry point." caption="The Developer Home tab opens folders, connects repositories, clones projects, and starts Developer Studio workspaces." />

<Screenshot id="developer-workspace" alt="Row-Bot Developer Studio with an isolated demonstration repository." caption="The Developer workspace keeps repository identity, changed files, inspector state, conversation, commands, and review controls together." />

## Where To Find It

Open Home -> Developer. Choose an existing folder, connect a repository already on your machine, or clone a repository into a local workspace.

## End-To-End Workflow

1. Open or clone a project.
2. Confirm the workspace name, path, branch, and dirty state.
3. Ask Developer chat a code question or assign a change.
4. Review the inspector for files, detected commands, todos, context, and approvals.
5. Approve only the commands or edits you understand.
6. Run tests or checks.
7. Review the changed files before committing or exporting a patch.

## UI Walkthrough

- **Open folder** connects a local project without cloning.
- **Connect repository** uses a local Git checkout.
- **Clone repository** creates a new checkout from a remote URL.
- **Developer chat** is the conversation bound to that workspace.
- **Inspector** shows workspace identity, files, command suggestions, todos, changes, and run state.
- **File/context panel** helps Row-Bot and you see what code is relevant.
- **Command controls** run detected or requested commands through approval policy.
- **Change review** summarizes edits and lets you inspect before accepting next steps.

## Sandbox Modes

Local mode lets Row-Bot operate in the selected workspace with your configured file and command permissions. Docker Sandbox mode, when available on a host installation, isolates command execution in a container and requires an import step before changes affect the real workspace. It requires a supported host Docker runtime and can differ from your local environment.

Inside the official Row-Bot application container, Developer Docker Sandbox is unavailable and a requested Docker workspace fails closed; Row-Bot never probes a nested daemon or silently runs that workspace locally. Local mode remains an explicit choice and can see only workspace paths deliberately mounted into the application container.

An approved risky Custom Tool is a third case: it deliberately executes in Local mode inside the application container against the selected visible Custom Tool path. That behavior is shown in the approval dialog and is not a nested Docker sandbox or fallback from a requested Docker workspace. See [Docker And VPS Operations](/docs/operations/docker#developer-and-headless-boundaries) for the complete container boundary.

For a host installation, start with Local mode on a disposable branch. Use Docker Sandbox when you want stronger isolation and the supported host runtime is available.

## Troubleshooting

- If Developer tools are unavailable, open a Developer workspace first.
- If commands are missing, inspect detected commands or ask Row-Bot to identify the project tooling.
- If a command asks for approval, read the exact command and workspace before approving.
- If Docker sandbox import is offered, review the patch before importing it into the real project.

# Knowledge

Knowledge is Row-Bot's local memory and retrieval area. It includes saved memories, extracted document information, graph records, entity relationships, and background organization that can help future chats.

For the relationship between thread history, memory, documents, the graph, Wiki Vault, and Dream Cycle, read [How Memory Becomes Knowledge](/docs/concepts/memory-knowledge-and-dream-cycle).

## Where To Find It

Open Home -> Knowledge. Configure memory and embeddings in Settings -> Knowledge and Settings -> Documents.

## UI Walkthrough

- **List or grid** shows available knowledge records.
- **Filters** narrow records by type, source, status, or search text.
- **Detail cards** show the exact record, source, confidence, timestamps, and related information when available.
- **Edit mode** lets you correct useful information instead of deleting everything around it.
- **Dream cycle controls** review or trigger background organization when enabled.
- **Extraction journal links** connect Knowledge to Monitor so you can see how records were created.

## Common Workflow

1. Open Knowledge after a few useful chats or document imports.
2. Filter to the topic you care about.
3. Open a detail card.
4. Correct or remove misleading records.
5. Ask Chat to use knowledge only after you have verified important entries.

## What Is Saved

Knowledge records are local data. They can be used as context in future chats when memory, document search, or knowledge retrieval is enabled.

## Troubleshooting

- If Knowledge is empty, enable memory or index documents first.
- If records are wrong, edit or remove them.
- If retrieval feels noisy, reduce memory/search settings and review graph entries.

- **Status labels** identify running, idle, disabled, warning, or failed states.

## Logs And Journals

Recent logs help with immediate diagnosis. The knowledge extraction journal explains what Row-Bot extracted from conversations or documents. The dream journal explains background organization attempts. Use journals when you need a narrative of why a knowledge record or background status exists.

## Common Workflow

1. Reproduce or observe the issue.
2. Open Monitor and refresh.
3. Check status labels and recent logs.
4. Open the relevant journal.
5. Copy only non-sensitive details into a support request.

## What Is Saved

Logs and journals are local Row-Bot data. They may include file names, thread names, provider names, channel names, or task summaries, so review them before sharing.

## Troubleshooting

- If logs are empty, reproduce the issue and refresh.
- If background work is disabled, check Settings -> Preferences and Settings -> Knowledge.
- If a channel is stopped, open Settings -> Channels before restarting it.

# Settings

Settings is Row-Bot's configuration center. It affects model providers, model choices, documents, search, skills, system access, accounts, utilities, tracker, knowledge, Buddy, voice, channels, MCP, plugins, and preferences.

Authenticated owner sessions receive this complete Settings experience in both desktop and compact presentation. On phones and tablets, the layout adapts to the viewport; the available settings and authority do not change.

## How Settings Is Organized

- **Providers** connects local, hosted, subscription, and custom model providers.
- **Models** chooses defaults and pinned Quick Choices.
- **Documents** manages uploads, extraction, embeddings, and vector rebuilds.
- **Tools** controls progressive external capability loading, retrieval compression, and search and knowledge tools.
- **Skills** manages Smart Skills and Skills Hub access.
- **System** configures local access, workspace boundaries, window behavior, tunnels, logs, and diagnostics.
- **Accounts** connects account-level integrations.
- **Utilities** manages built-in helper tools.
- **Tracker** configures structured personal logs.
- **Knowledge** manages memory, graph, embeddings, and wiki export.
- **Buddy** controls companion visibility and appearance, plus the native drag-to-undock desktop overlay and its compact selected-thread experience.
- **Voice** configures Talk, Dictate, read-aloud, models, devices, and diagnostics.
- **Channels** configures external messaging connectors.
- **MCP** manages external MCP tool servers.
- **Plugins** manages installed plugins and Custom Tool promotion.
- **Preferences** changes identity, launch behavior, background intelligence, updates, and migration.

## A Good Setup Order

1. Providers
2. Models
3. Documents and Tools
4. Skills
5. System access
6. Integrations: Accounts, Channels, MCP, Plugins
7. Voice and Buddy
8. Preferences

## Safety Notes

Credentials belong in Providers, Accounts, Channels, MCP, or plugin-specific settings, not in chat messages. Enable only the tools and integrations you intend to use. Review approvals before actions that write files, run commands, use accounts, contact external services, or send messages.

# Channels

Channels connect Row-Bot to external messaging platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, and SMS-style providers when configured. Use channels when you want to message Row-Bot outside the desktop app or send workflow results somewhere specific.

<Screenshot id="settings-channels" alt="Row-Bot Channels settings." caption="Channels settings show connector configuration, credentials, tunnel use, pairing, and start/stop controls." />

## Setup Workflow

1. Open Settings -> Channels.
2. Expand the channel you want.
3. Add the required token, URL, phone/account detail, or provider-specific field.
4. Configure a tunnel in Settings -> System if the channel requires an inbound webhook.
5. Save the channel.
6. Start the channel.
7. Pair or approve users before trusting private messages.
8. Test with a low-risk message.

## Controls

- **Save** stores channel settings.
- **Start** begins the channel runtime.
- **Stop** shuts the channel runtime down.
- **Tunnel controls** connect a channel to a public webhook URL when needed.
- **DM Pairing Code** approves a user before private-message access.
- **Paired Users** lists approved users and lets you revoke access.
- **Setup Guide** explains platform-specific prerequisites.
- **`/reasoning`** shows or changes the reasoning choice for that channel conversation's active model. Run it without an argument to see the exact valid choices.

## Safety

Messages sent through a channel leave the local app. Do not enable a channel until you understand who can message it, what Row-Bot can send back, and whether workflows may deliver results there.

When work starts from a channel and a child agent asks for approval, Row-Bot sends the approval back to that parent channel conversation when the channel supports approval messages. The same approval remains visible in the desktop parent thread and Activity Center.

## Troubleshooting

- If Telegram encounters one transient network failure during initialization, Row-Bot cleans up the partial runtime and retries once. Persistent network failures remain stopped with an actionable diagnostic; invalid bot tokens are not retried.
- If Telegram starts but its command menu cannot be registered, polling remains available and the menu failure is logged as non-fatal.
- If a channel cannot start, check required fields and tunnel state. Automatic tunnel startup runs outside the UI event loop, so a slow tunnel helper should report status without freezing app startup.
- If inbound messages fail, verify webhook URLs and platform permissions.
- If the wrong person has access, revoke them from Paired Users.

# MCP

MCP lets Row-Bot use tools exposed by external Model Context Protocol servers. An MCP server can be local or remote, simple or powerful. Treat it like an extension with its own access and trust boundary.

## Setup Workflow

1. Open Settings -> MCP.
2. Leave Enable MCP off until a trusted server is configured.
3. Add, import, or browse for a server.
4. Review the command, arguments, URL, transport, and expected tools.
5. Save disabled first if you are unsure.
6. Test the server.
7. Enable the server only after you understand what it can access.

## Controls

- **Enable MCP** turns all external MCP tools on or off.
- **Add Server** opens the manual server form.
- **Import Config** imports server definitions from configuration text.
- **Browse MCP Servers** searches available server directories.
- **Diagnostics** helps explain connection failures.
- **Per-server enablement** decides whether a saved server contributes tools.
- **Test, refresh, edit, delete** manage the server row.

## Safety

MCP tools can read, write, call APIs, or automate services depending on the server. Row-Bot approvals still matter, but you should also trust the server itself before enabling it.

## Troubleshooting

- If a server fails to test, check transport, command, arguments, URL, and dependencies.
- If tools are missing, enable both the global MCP switch and the server.
- If a prompt asks for unexpected access, reject it and inspect the server configuration.

- **Pin** keeps an important skill easy to reach.
- **Create/edit** lets you maintain a local skill for your own workflow.

## Creating A Skill

1. Decide what task the skill should help with.
2. Write concise instructions, examples, and boundaries.
3. Include when the skill should and should not be used.
4. Save it locally.
5. Enable it and test with a small prompt.
6. Revise if Row-Bot overuses or misunderstands it.

## What Skills Change

Skills shape Row-Bot's behavior; they do not automatically grant credentials or bypass approvals. A skill can make Row-Bot more consistent for a task, but tools still need to be enabled and approved where appropriate.

## Troubleshooting

- If a skill is not used, make your prompt match its purpose and confirm it is enabled.
- If a skill is too aggressive, disable or rewrite it with clearer boundaries.
- If an external skill is unfamiliar, inspect it before enabling.

# Voice And Buddy

Voice and Buddy make Row-Bot feel less like a text box and more like a desktop companion. Voice handles speech input and optional spoken output. In the native Windows and macOS apps, Buddy can be dragged from the sidebar into a compact always-on-top desktop overlay.

<Screenshot id="settings-voice" alt="Row-Bot Voice settings." caption="Voice settings control Dictate, Talk, read-aloud, voice models, devices, and diagnostics." />

## Voice Modes

- **Dictate** turns speech into composer text so you can review it before sending.
- **Talk** submits spoken input more directly for conversation.
- **Read-aloud** speaks assistant responses when enabled.
- **Local voice** uses local speech components where available.
- **Realtime voice** uses a compatible provider for lower-latency spoken conversation.

## Choosing A Mode

Use Dictate when accuracy and review matter. Use Talk when you want a faster hands-light conversation. Use local voice when privacy and offline-style behavior matter. Use realtime voice when latency matters and you accept internet access, provider requirements, and provider cost.

## Devices And Diagnostics

Select the microphone and output device in Settings -> Voice. Run diagnostics when audio is silent, delayed, or routed to the wrong device.

<Screenshot id="settings-buddy" alt="Row-Bot Buddy settings." caption="Buddy settings control companion visibility, personality, look, motion, and optional custom-look generation." />

## Buddy Controls

- **Show Buddy** controls companion visibility.
- **Drag to tear off** moves Buddy itself from the sidebar into the native overlay; releasing over the dock cancels the drag.
- The overlay shares the selected thread's saved draft, current response, model, tools, and approval mode.
- Enter sends, Shift+Enter adds a line, and Stop stops the selected thread's active response.
- Simple approvals can be settled in Buddy; complex approvals open the full thread for review.
- Open full thread, Collapse or Expand, Dock Buddy, and Hide Buddy are in the overlay menu.
- **Companion personality** changes the tone of Buddy cues.
- **Bubble style** changes status presentation.
- **Look cards** choose bundled or custom appearances.
- **Generate full Buddy**, **Retry motion**, and **Use still only** manage custom looks.

See [Settings: Buddy](/docs/settings/buddy) for the complete drag, messaging, approval, tray-recovery, and troubleshooting walkthrough.

## Talk To Buddy

The overlay accepts typed messages for the thread named in its header. Talk and Dictate remain in the full Row-Bot thread, where microphone state and provider disclosure are visible. Use Open full thread before starting voice; Buddy continues reflecting that selected conversation.

## Privacy And Safety

Voice input can become chat text. Realtime voice and provider-backed speech may send audio or transcript data to the selected provider. Buddy preferences and assets are local, but custom generation may call a configured media provider.

## Troubleshooting

- If Dictate records nothing, check microphone selection and permissions.
- If Talk sends too quickly, use Dictate instead.
- If realtime voice is unavailable, check Providers and Voice Models.
- If Buddy does not appear, enable Show Buddy or use the tray's Show Buddy action when it is torn off.
- If Buddy will not undock, use the native Windows or macOS app and start the drag on Buddy itself. Browser/server mode keeps it docked.

        """
# Privacy And Safety

Row-Bot is local-first: the app and its data live on your machine. Local-first does not mean every feature is offline. Hosted models, web search, browser actions, account tools, channels, MCP servers, plugins, realtime voice, and media providers can send data outside the app when you configure and use them.

## Local Data

Conversations, memories, documents, workflows, logs, Designer projects, Developer workspaces, skills, plugins, Buddy assets, and settings are stored in the active local Row-Bot data directory. Buddy's native overlay reuses the selected conversation and does not create a second transcript store.

## External Calls

External calls happen when you choose or enable something that needs them: hosted models, subscription providers, API providers, web search, browser automation, account tools, messaging channels, MCP servers, plugin tools, realtime voice, and media generation.

Computer Use is a distinct opt-in boundary. Row-Bot downloads the pinned Cua Driver only after an explicit Install or Repair action, verifies the selected archive, and requires the current telemetry disclosure before any executable invocation. The reviewed 0.20.0 upstream telemetry includes pseudonymous identifiers and bounded product, platform, client, tool/outcome, duration/output, aggregate usage, permission, and lifecycle categories; its tagged event builders exclude prompts, tool arguments/results, typed text, screenshots, accessibility trees, app/window names, URLs, paths, raw values, and raw errors. See [Computer Use](/docs/computer-use/) for the full boundary.

## Credentials

Enter credentials only in the relevant Settings tab or provider sign-in flow. Row-Bot stores secrets in the operating system key store when available and keeps local metadata for status and diagnostics. An explicitly configured server deployment can use a read-only external master-key file to encrypt owner-entered secrets in its persistent data directory; see [Docker And VPS Operations](/docs/operations/docker#read-only-secret-files).

## Remote Access

Remote Access is single-owner and multi-device. A Tailscale, LAN, SSH, Docker, or reverse-proxy route provides reachability only; each non-local browser still needs a one-time invitation and a revocable Row-Bot session.

Every authenticated interactive browser has full owner authority. Phone/tablet and computer choices select compact or desktop presentation only; device metadata and screen size are not permission boundaries. Row-Bot does not provide guest or multi-user sharing.

Invitation links expire after 10 minutes and work once, but should still be treated like passwords until they expire. Row-Bot stores only hashed invitation and session secrets. Session credentials use HttpOnly cookies and are not placed in URLs.

Prefer Tailscale or HTTPS for remote access. Plain LAN HTTP is unencrypted and does not support a remote browser microphone. For an operator-managed proxy, allow only the canonical browser-facing origin and trust only the exact address that connects from the proxy to Row-Bot. Never resolve a forwarding-header error by trusting every private address or a whole container network.

See [Remote Access And Server Mode](/docs/operations/remote-access) for layouts, lifetimes, revocation, Tailscale ownership, server mode, Docker, and recovery.

## Approvals

Use approvals to review file writes, command execution, browser actions, account actions, channel sends, MCP calls, plugin tools, Developer changes, and other sensitive actions. Reject anything that does not match your request.

Approval mode is policy, not a model choice: blocked actions stay blocked, ask-mode actions wait for you, and auto-approved actions follow the configured policy. Some prompts include a short model-written reason for readability, but the underlying approval gate and action details are system-controlled.

## Sharing Logs Or Screenshots

Before sharing logs, screenshots, documents, thread exports, or review packages, check for names, file paths, account names, message contents, tokens, private documents, or misleading real data.

## Safer Defaults

- Start with local models when privacy matters most.
- Keep channels, MCP, and plugins disabled until needed.
- Keep Computer Use disabled until a local interactive task needs native application control.
- Keep Remote Access off until another trusted device needs it; use the narrowest route and the appropriate layout.
- Use narrow workspaces for file tools.

# Profiles, Goals, And Agents

These three features work together but solve different problems. An **Agent Profile** is a reusable role and policy. A **goal** is a bounded objective for the current task. An **agent run** is one execution of delegated work, with its own status and evidence.

For the mental model behind delegation and hand-offs, read [How Profiles, Goals, And Agents Work](/docs/concepts/profiles-goals-and-agents).

<Screenshot id="agent-profile-library" alt="Row-Bot Agent Profile library with fictional Research Guide and Project Coordinator profiles." caption="Agent Profiles package reusable instructions, skills, tools, model policy, and approval policy without changing the underlying thread history." />

## Choose Or Create A Profile

1. Open a chat and expand **Agent profiles** in the left sidebar.
2. Choose a built-in profile or create one for a repeated role.
3. Keep the role narrow: describe the outcome, sources it may use, and what it must not do.
4. Review its model, skill, tool, delegation, and approval policy.
5. Save it, then select it before asking for work.

Profiles do not grant capabilities by themselves. A selected tool must still be enabled, available, and allowed by the active approval policy. A profile that can delegate may start child agents, but each run remains visible in the Activity Center and the chat agent strip.

New runs also receive a checkpointed work budget. The Models settings tab shows the recommended application-wide work-round, nesting, concurrency, and optional child active-time limits. Extra children wait in a first-in, first-out queue when capacity is full; changing a setting affects new runs, not work already in progress.

<Screenshot id="goal-and-agents" alt="Row-Bot active goal and delegated agents for a fictional launch checklist." caption="The goal strip records bounded progress while parent and child agent rows show who is running, complete, waiting, or stopped." />

## Run A Goal

A goal is useful when work needs more than one turn. State the objective and an observable finish condition. Row-Bot records progress, blockers, evidence, turns, and status so it can continue without pretending that partial work is complete.

- **Active** means work can continue.
- **Complete** means the objective and required checks are genuinely finished.
- **Blocked** is for a repeated impasse that requires your input or an external change.
- **Stop** ends the active run; it does not delete the thread or its evidence.

## Review Delegated Work

Parent agents coordinate. Child agents handle bounded subtasks. Open an agent row to review its prompt, profile, model, status, result, evidence, and thread. A completed child result is evidence for the parent, not automatic permission to write files, send messages, commit code, or publish.

If a run appears stuck, inspect its last update before stopping it. If several agents edit the same resource, narrow their ownership or run them sequentially. Keep consequential final actions with the parent and a human approval point.

Repeated model-and-tool states are detected before a run can loop indefinitely. The fourth identical no-progress state is blocked; a fifth ends the run cleanly with a durable reason. Reaching a configured work limit also finalizes the run instead of leaving it marked as active.

## What Is Saved

Profiles, goals, agent runs, edges, progress, results, and evidence are stored in the active local data directory. Provider prompts still follow the privacy terms of the model route selected for each run.

        "Generate and maintain a local Markdown vault from reviewed Row-Bot knowledge.",
        """
# Wiki Vault

Wiki Vault turns selected Knowledge entities and relationships into linked Markdown pages in a folder you control. It is an output of the local knowledge graph, not a replacement for the underlying memory and provenance records.

## Configure The Vault

1. Open **Settings -> Knowledge**.
2. Choose a vault folder that is separate from application code and important personal notes while you test.
3. Enable Wiki output only after reviewing the current Knowledge graph.
4. Run the rebuild or sync action shown in the tab.
5. Open the generated Markdown pages in your preferred editor and check links, titles, and source notes.

The vault contains generated summaries and links. Correct important facts in Knowledge first, then rebuild, so the graph remains the source of truth. Avoid hand-editing generated sections unless the page clearly identifies an area intended for manual notes.

## Updates And Deletions

New or changed entities can update their corresponding pages. Removed or merged records may cause generated pages or links to change on the next rebuild. Back up a vault before a large repair, migration, or rebuild if it also contains your own notes.

## Privacy

The vault is local, but it is deliberately easy to open in other software or sync with a third-party folder. Treat the destination as an export boundary. Review it before placing it in cloud storage, a shared repository, or a publishing system.

## Troubleshooting

- If pages are empty, verify that Knowledge contains reviewed entities and relations.
- If links duplicate, run Knowledge repair before rebuilding the vault.
- If a path is unavailable, choose a writable local folder and try again.
- If private material appears, correct or remove its source record, rebuild, and review the destination before sharing.

        """
# Knowledge Provenance And Repair

Knowledge is useful only when you can tell where it came from. Review provenance before relying on a memory, document fact, entity, or relation for consequential work.

## Review A Record

1. Open **Home -> Knowledge** and filter to the topic.
2. Open the record detail.
3. Check its source, timestamps, type, confidence or status, and related entities.
4. Compare important claims with the original conversation or document.
5. Correct, merge, or remove the record if it is misleading.

## Repair Order

Use the smallest repair that fixes the problem:

1. Correct a title, type, description, or relation.
2. Merge a duplicate entity when both records refer to the same thing.
3. Remove a bad relation without deleting sound entities.
4. Rebuild derived indexes if search still returns stale results.
5. Rebuild Wiki Vault output only after the graph is correct.

Monitor's extraction and Dream Cycle journals help explain background changes. A repair should preserve useful source evidence and avoid touching unrelated memories.

## Recovery

Before a large repair or migration, close Row-Bot and back up the active data directory. Restore the whole related data set together rather than mixing database files from different moments. If the app offers a built-in repair action, read its scope and completion message before manually replacing files.

Conversation deletion is coordinated across Row-Bot-managed messages, checkpoints, attachments, tool sessions, workflows, Agents, Designer links, and Developer session records. It first stops active work, prevents late checkpoints from recreating the conversation, and then repeats the cleanup after producers finish. Changed Developer worktrees and sandboxes with unimported work are retained and reported. Idle maintenance may remove abandoned temporary files and compact sufficiently fragmented Row-Bot SQLite databases, but it stays within verified managed roots and skips busy databases.

## Safety Boundary

Deleting a conversation removes Row-Bot-managed conversation state but does not erase memories or external records that were deliberately created from it, nor files already exported outside managed storage. Deleting one graph entity can affect linked output. Review the exact record and its relationships first, and never run repair tests against a personal data directory.

        """
# Computer Use

Computer Use is Row-Bot's provider-neutral tool for operating native Windows and macOS applications. It is separate from browser automation: use Browser for web pages and Computer Use only when the task must interact with a desktop application window.

Computer Use is a beta feature. It is off by default, supports one interactive local task at a time, and is unavailable to schedules, channels, background workflows, child agents, plugins, external MCP callers, mobile clients, and headless or server sessions.

## Set It Up

1. Open **Settings -> System -> Browser & Computer Use**.
2. Expand **Computer Use (Beta)** and read the capability and privacy summary.
3. Choose **Install**. Row-Bot shows the required Cua Driver telemetry disclosure before it downloads or starts anything.
4. Choose **Continue** only if you accept the disclosure. Row-Bot downloads the pinned Cua Driver 0.20.0 full archive for your platform, verifies its SHA-256, and extracts it into Row-Bot's private data directory. Upgrading from an older reviewed driver requires accepting the expanded version-2 telemetry notice again.
5. On macOS, grant Accessibility and Screen Recording to the Row-Bot process when prompted, then choose **Recheck**. Restart the same process after changing permissions if the status asks you to.
6. Turn on **Computer Use (Beta)** after the setup card reports ready.

Install, Repair, Reinstall, Remove, and system-binary controls affect only the optional driver. Row-Bot never runs the upstream installer or updater. A custom system binary is accepted only after explicit opt-in and version verification.

## Run A Native Task

Ask from a normal local desktop chat and name the application and desired outcome. Row-Bot discovers applications and windows, acquires one exclusive task lease, and binds actions to the selected target window. It can launch an allowlisted application, observe that window, click, type, press keys, scroll, and drag when the current policy permits the operation.

When accessibility data is insufficient, Row-Bot may send one ephemeral target-window screenshot to the Vision model configured in Settings. The live control card shows sanitized state and a shielded thumbnail; screenshot bytes are not written to chat, durable memory, replay history, logs, or tool results.

## Stop Or Take Over

- **Stop** cancels queued work and releases the session.
- **Take over** cancels queued mutation and pauses the lease so you can interact directly.
- **Resume** requires Row-Bot to observe the target again before it can act.

Window replacement, permission loss, target changes, or driver failure invalidates stale state. Row-Bot must reacquire and observe before another mutation.

## Safety Boundaries

Computer Use blocks terminals, password managers, Row-Bot itself, secure desktops, elevation prompts, security settings, and attempts to handle credentials, one-time codes, CAPTCHAs, biometrics, or operating-system permission dialogs. Consequential actions use approval policy at the point of risk, and external handoff flows stay with the user.

The reviewed Cua 0.20.0 telemetry sends pseudonymous installation/process-session identifiers and bounded product, platform, client, tool/outcome, duration/output, aggregate session/config/cursor/recording, permission, and lifecycle categories to Cua's EU PostHog endpoint. Its tagged event builders do not receive prompts, tool arguments/results, typed text, screenshots, accessibility trees, app/window names, URLs, paths, raw config/cursor values, or raw errors. Row-Bot adds no first-party telemetry and keeps its prompts, files, memories, secrets, screenshots, tool arguments, and channel content outside Cua telemetry.

For the exact allowlist and reviewed dependency record, see [Computer Use Beta: architecture and security decision](https://github.com/siddsachar/row-bot/blob/main/docs/COMPUTER_USE_SECURITY.md).

## Troubleshooting

- If setup reports an archive or checksum error, choose **Repair** and retry on a trusted network.
- If macOS reports missing permission, use the provided buttons to open Accessibility and Screen Recording settings, grant the running Row-Bot process, restart it, and recheck.
- If the requested app is blocked, do not work around the policy with a terminal or generic MCP tool. Operate it manually or use a narrower supported application.
- If a session is busy, stop or finish the active Computer Use task before starting another.
- If the target window closes or changes, ask Row-Bot to reacquire it before resuming.

# Android And Native Desktop

Row-Bot's mobile layout gives an authenticated Android browser the full owner product in a compact presentation. Chat, Activity, workflows, Knowledge, and complete phone-safe Settings remain available. The native desktop build adds operating-system integration such as window, tray, microphone, file-picker, and updater behaviour. Layout never changes Row-Bot authority or the approval rules of the underlying task.

<Screenshot id="mobile-chat-detail" alt="Android-sized Row-Bot chat detail for a fictional launch checklist." caption="The compact thread view keeps transcript, model context, attachments, approvals, and composer controls within the phone layout." />

## Pair An Android Device

1. On an authorized owner device, open **Settings → System → Remote Access**.
2. Check Tailscale or explicitly enable the narrowest connection route that fits your network.
3. Select **Invite a device**, then choose **Phone or tablet — Compact layout**.
4. Choose a trusted 30-day or temporary 12-hour session and a currently reachable connection route.
5. Create the invitation and open the shown link or QR code on Android.
6. Review the connection page on Android and press **Connect** before the invitation expires.
7. Revoke the device or an individual session from Remote Access settings when it is lost, replaced, or no longer trusted.

<Screenshot id="remote-access-invitation" alt="Remote Access invitation configured for a phone or tablet." caption="Phone and computer choices select presentation only. Every connected browser receives full owner access." />

The invitation expires after 10 minutes and works once. Opening it does not consume it until the recipient presses **Connect**. The resulting owner session is a separate HttpOnly browser credential and never appears in the URL.

Pairing grants access to your local Row-Bot instance. Do not share an invitation, expose the local server broadly, or use remote LAN HTTP on an untrusted network. Tailscale or an operator-managed HTTPS origin is preferred and is required for browser microphone capture away from localhost. See [Remote Access And Server Mode](/docs/operations/remote-access) for the complete connection and recovery model.

Mobile Settings includes Providers, Models, Knowledge, Buddy, Voice, System and Remote Access, Tracker, Documents, Tools, Skills, Accounts, Channels, Utilities, MCP, Plugins, and Preferences. Rich Developer Studio and Designer Studio editors remain desktop-layout-oriented and show an explanatory notice in compact presentation.

## Native-Only Checks

Some states cannot be reproduced faithfully in browser automation: OS microphone prompts, native file pickers, tray menus, updater/restart dialogs, Computer Use takeover, and physical-device network permission. The public guide documents their intent; release review must test them on the target operating system and a physical Android device.

## Troubleshooting

- If the phone cannot connect, confirm the host, port, access mode, firewall, and network reachability shown on desktop.
- If an invitation expires or was already consumed, create a new one rather than copying cookies or local credential files.
- If the connection page opens but the app remains unavailable, confirm the recipient pressed **Connect** and that the device or session was not revoked.
- If an approval is missing, open Activity and confirm the relevant thread is still active.
- If the mobile layout opens on desktop, use `?mobile=0` or reopen the normal local address. Switching layout does not require a new session.

# Extend Row-Bot

Start with the narrowest extension type that can solve the task. Every extension adds capabilities; some also add code, dependencies, network access, credentials, or external side effects.

For the conceptual differences between tools, Skills, plugins, MCP, channels, and accounts, read [Extensions And Trust Boundaries](/docs/concepts/extensions-and-trust).

| Extension | Use It For | Review Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Built-in tool | A capability already shipped and maintained with Row-Bot. | Enable only the tools a profile needs; consequential operations still use approval policy. |
| Skill | Reusable instructions and workflow knowledge. | Read the full skill and bundled files before enabling or pinning it. |
| Custom Tool | A reviewed local command or repo-specific helper created in Developer Studio. | Inspect its source, command classification, dependencies, and workspace scope. |
| Plugin | A packaged bundle that can provide tools, skills, channels, MCP configuration, or UI. | Review manifest, source, permissions, dependencies, and update path before enabling. |
| MCP server | Tools exposed by an external local or remote process. | Add disabled, inspect overlap and risk labels, test, then enable only trusted tools. |
| Channel | A messaging adapter for receiving or delivering work. | Verify account, recipients, pairing, tunnel, and delivery defaults before starting. |
| Account | Authorisation for GitHub, Google, X, or another service used by tools. | Review requested scopes and disconnect unused accounts. |

## Safe Evaluation Sequence

1. Read the extension description and source.
2. Check requested permissions, credentials, network destinations, commands, and install steps.
3. Install into the local data directory only from a source you trust.
4. Keep it disabled while you inspect configuration and provided capabilities.
5. Test with fictional data and a non-consequential task.
6. Enable the minimum capabilities and keep approval mode at **Ask** until behaviour is familiar.
7. Disable or remove extensions that are no longer maintained or needed.

Third-party dependency telemetry is not Row-Bot telemetry. Review and accept any dependency behaviour before installation, and never allow it to receive Row-Bot prompts, files, memories, secrets, screenshots, tool arguments, or channel content unless that transfer is the explicit feature you chose.

# Accounts And Authorisation

Accounts let selected tools act through services such as GitHub, Google, or X. A model provider account supplies models; an integration account supplies service access. They are configured separately.

## Connect Safely

1. Open **Settings -> Accounts**.
2. Choose the service and read the status and requested purpose.
3. Prefer the supported OAuth or local CLI flow rather than pasting broad tokens.
4. Verify the service, account, and scopes in the external authorisation page.
5. Return to Row-Bot and refresh status.
6. Test a read-only action before approving writes, posts, email, calendar, or repository changes.

<Screenshot id="settings-accounts" alt="Row-Bot Accounts settings with external services disconnected." caption="Account rows keep connection status and actions visible without displaying stored credentials." />

## Tokens And Scopes

Secrets use the configured operating-system secret store when available. Settings show status, not the secret value. A service may still retain its own authorisation grant until you revoke it there. Use the narrowest scopes that support the feature and disconnect access you no longer use.

## Troubleshooting

- Confirm the system browser returned to the same Row-Bot instance that started the flow.
- For GitHub CLI, refresh CLI authorisation after signing in or changing accounts.
- If a callback fails, repeat the supported flow instead of copying browser storage.
- If an action is denied after connection, review both the service scopes and the Row-Bot approval policy.

        """
# How A Request Runs

A Row-Bot request is a controlled loop, not a single message sent blindly to every connected service.

1. **A thread provides continuity.** Your message joins the selected conversation. The thread supplies recent history and any thread-specific model or profile choice.
2. **Row-Bot assembles useful context.** Depending on your settings and request, this can include profile instructions, enabled Skills, attachments, and relevant local memory or document results. It does not mean the whole local data directory is attached.
3. **The selected model route receives the model prompt.** A local model keeps that inference on the configured local runtime. A hosted, API, subscription, or remote custom endpoint sends the assembled prompt to that provider under its terms.
4. **The model may answer or ask for a tool.** Row-Bot checks that the tool exists, is enabled for the active profile or workflow, and is permitted by policy.
5. **Consequential actions stop at an approval boundary.** The approval describes the proposed action and target. Rejecting it prevents that action; approving it does not give unrelated future actions permission.
6. **Tool results return to the active run.** A local file tool, browser, channel, account, plugin, or MCP server has its own execution and data boundary. The model can use the result to continue the loop.
7. **The result is recorded locally.** The thread keeps the conversation and run evidence. Optional extraction, memory, and document features decide what becomes reusable knowledge later.

## Three Boundaries To Keep In Mind

| Boundary | What crosses it | What controls it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Model route | The assembled prompt and later tool results needed for reasoning. | Selected provider/model, thread override, profile or workflow policy. |
| Tool execution | Arguments needed by a local or external capability. | Tool enablement, workspace or account scope, approval policy. |
| Durable knowledge | Reviewed or extracted information that may be recalled in another request. | Memory, Knowledge, document, embedding, and retention settings. |

Local-first describes where Row-Bot and its durable data live. It does not make a hosted model, web tool, channel, remote MCP server, realtime voice provider, or external account local.

## Change How Requests Run

- Choose routes and defaults in [Models And Providers](/docs/configuration/models-and-providers), [Provider Settings](/docs/settings/providers), and [Model Settings](/docs/settings/models).
- Control tools and approvals in [Tools, Approvals, And Terminal](/docs/chat/tools-approvals-and-terminal) and [Privacy And Safety](/docs/privacy-safety/).

# How Memory Becomes Knowledge

Row-Bot has several kinds of continuity. They work together, but none is a magical copy of everything the app has ever seen.

| Layer | What it represents | How it is used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Thread history | Messages, attachments, tool traces, approvals, and results in one conversation. | Keeps the current conversation coherent and reviewable. |
| Memory | Reusable facts, preferences, summaries, and events saved or extracted for later recall. | Supplies selected relevant context to future requests when enabled. |
| Documents | Files deliberately added to the document library and split into searchable content. | Finds passages related to a question without placing every document in every prompt. |
| Knowledge Graph | Local entities and directed relationships with source and confidence information. | Connects related people, projects, events, facts, and sources during review and recall. |
| Wiki Vault | Linked Markdown pages generated from reviewed graph material. | Makes a portable, human-browsable projection in a folder you choose. |

## From Conversation To Recall

When extraction is enabled, Row-Bot can identify useful information from eligible conversations or documents and save structured records. Search combines the available lexical, vector, and graph signals to choose candidates relevant to a later request. Recall refreshes useful memories; it does not make every stored item equally likely to appear.

Vector search uses an embedding model, which is separate from the chat model. First launch offers Mixedbread Embed Large v1 as a checked-by-default 675 MB local download. If it is skipped, unavailable, or still loading, Row-Bot continues with bounded lexical and graph fallback instead of silently downloading during a chat. Install, retry, or repair the local model later in [Documents Settings](/docs/settings/documents), then rebuild document and memory vectors after changing models. Cloud embeddings are an explicit alternative that sends indexed text to the selected provider.

The source record matters. A graph relation or memory should remain traceable to the conversation, document, or process that produced it. Correct the underlying Knowledge record before rebuilding derived indexes or Wiki Vault pages.

## What Dream Cycle Does

Dream Cycle is idle-time knowledge maintenance. When enabled and due, it can examine the local knowledge set, merge high-confidence duplicates, refresh summaries from available source context, infer strongly supported relationships, and prune stale low-confidence inferred relations. It records a journal so you can review what happened.

Dream Cycle is not an autonomous second assistant and it does not make external facts true. It should run only during the configured window while the app is idle. Inferred relationships use confidence thresholds, but important knowledge still deserves human review.

## What Wiki Vault Does

Wiki Vault writes a readable view of selected graph material. The graph remains the source of truth; the vault is a generated output. If the destination is synced to a cloud drive, repository, or publishing tool, that folder becomes a separate sharing boundary.

## Configure And Review It

- Review records in [Knowledge](/docs/knowledge/) and investigate changes in [Monitor](/docs/monitor/).
- Configure extraction, recall, embeddings, graph maintenance, Dream Cycle, and Wiki output in [Knowledge Settings](/docs/settings/knowledge).

        """
# How Profiles, Goals, And Agents Work

Profiles, goals, and agent runs describe different parts of long-running work.

- An **Agent Profile** is a reusable operating role: instructions, model policy, Skills, tools, delegation limits, and approval policy.
- A **goal** is the durable objective and finish condition for a piece of work that may span several turns.
- An **agent run** is one execution attempt with a prompt, model, status, result, and evidence.
- A **parent agent** coordinates the objective and combines results.
- A **child agent** receives a bounded subtask and returns a hand-off to its parent.

## Why Delegate

Delegation is useful when independent research, inspection, or implementation can happen in parallel or needs a specialist profile. It is less useful when agents would edit the same small resource or when only one decision is needed. The parent remains responsible for deciding whether the combined evidence actually completes the goal.

Child agents do not become invisible background permissions. Their runs remain linked to the parent, and a returned result is evidence rather than automatic authorisation to write, send, publish, or declare the goal complete. Tool availability and approvals still apply to the run doing the action.

Delegation capacity is bounded. Each new run snapshots the application-wide work-round, nesting, per-parent concurrency, app-wide concurrency, and optional child active-time settings. When capacity is full, eligible children wait in a first-in, first-out queue rather than bypassing the limits.

## Status And Hand-Offs

An active goal can accumulate progress across turns. Completion should mean the finish condition and required checks are satisfied. A block should identify a real impasse, not merely unfinished work. Stopping an agent ends that run without deleting the parent thread, goal history, or already-recorded evidence.

The work-round budget is checked at model, tool, and resume boundaries so a restart cannot reset it. Repeated no-progress states are blocked and then terminated cleanly, and every terminal path writes one durable final status and reason.

A useful child-agent hand-off says what was checked, what changed, what evidence was found, what remains uncertain, and whether any consequential action still needs the parent or user.

A workflow is a saved task definition. A run is one attempt to execute it. Keeping those separate lets Row-Bot preserve history when you edit the next schedule or retry a failed attempt.

1. **A trigger starts a run.** This can be a manual click, a recurring schedule, a one-time time, or another supported trigger.
2. **The run resolves its policy.** Row-Bot chooses the workflow's Agent Profile, model override, tools, Skills, steps, and approval mode.
3. **The run gets its own state.** Status, progress, step output, logs, and any persistent thread link are recorded so the scheduler can recover cleanly.
4. **Approval can pause the run.** A background action that needs a decision becomes a pending approval instead of silently continuing. Approving resumes that action; rejecting or expiring it leaves a visible run outcome.
5. **Completion and delivery are recorded separately.** A useful result can complete even if an external channel delivery fails, so the app can show the result and the delivery problem honestly.

## Delivery Defaults

The web app always receives run status. External channels are an additional destination.

- **Inherit defaults** means the workflow uses the current workflow-level external channel selection.
- **An explicit empty selection** means web app only, even when a global external default exists.
- **An explicit channel selection** targets those configured running channels.

This distinction prevents a workflow that was deliberately set to app-only from beginning to send externally after someone changes the global default.

## Failure And Retry

A failed run remains evidence; retrying creates another attempt rather than rewriting history. Fix the underlying provider, model, tool, approval, input, or delivery problem first. For multi-step work, keep steps narrow enough that the status identifies where the run stopped.

Scheduled work can outlive the screen where it was created, but it cannot outlive the local Row-Bot process indefinitely. Pausing a workflow prevents future schedule starts; stopping one active run does not necessarily change the saved schedule.

## Configure And Operate It

- Create schedules, profiles, approvals, steps, and delivery in [Workflows](/docs/guides/workflows).
- Configure external destinations in [Channels](/docs/integrations/channels) and [Channel Settings](/docs/settings/channels).
- Review live status in [Monitor](/docs/monitor/) and mobile Activity in [Mobile And Native Surfaces](/docs/mobile-native/).
- Back up workflow definitions and history with [Operations, Data, And Recovery](/docs/operations/).

# Extensions And Trust Boundaries

Row-Bot can learn a procedure, gain a tool, load code, connect a server, or authorise an account. Those are different changes and deserve different review.

| Capability | What it adds | Main trust question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Built-in tool | A maintained capability shipped with Row-Bot. | Is it enabled for this profile, and does this action need approval? |
| Skill | Instructions, examples, and supporting files that shape behaviour. | Do the instructions match your intent and avoid unexpected data or tool use? |
| Custom Tool | Reviewed local code or a command exposed as a reusable tool. | What code runs, in which workspace, with which dependencies and command class? |
| Plugin | A packaged extension that can add code, tools, Skills, channels, configuration, or UI. | Do you trust its publisher, source, permissions, dependencies, and update path? |
| MCP server | Tools supplied by a separate local process or remote service. | What can the server access, where does it run, and which of its tools are enabled? |
| Channel | A bridge for incoming messages or outgoing results. | Who can contact it, which conversation receives replies, and may workflows deliver there? |
| Account | Authorisation for a service such as GitHub, Google, or X. | Which service scopes and account data become available to enabled tools? |

## Instructions Are Not Permissions

A Skill or profile can tell the model when to use a capability, but it does not create credentials or bypass Row-Bot's tool and approval policy. Conversely, installing a plugin or MCP server can add real executable capability even when no Skill mentions it. Review both the guidance layer and the execution layer.

## Local Does Not Always Mean Harmless

A local plugin, command, or MCP process can still read files, start programs, or use locally stored credentials. A remote server or account can send data outside the app even if its configuration is stored locally. Use narrow workspaces, least-privilege accounts, disabled-by-default imports, and fictional test data.

Third-party dependency telemetry is not Row-Bot telemetry. Review dependency behaviour before installation and do not expose prompts, files, memories, secrets, screenshots, tool arguments, or channel content unless that transfer is the feature you intentionally selected.

## Browse And Configure Extensions

- Compare extension types and browse screenshots in [Extend Row-Bot](/docs/extending/).
- Browse and review Skills in [Skills Hub](/docs/skills/) and [Skills Settings](/docs/settings/skills).
- Install and control packaged code in [Plugins](/docs/integrations/plugins) and [Plugin Settings](/docs/settings/plugins).
- Browse, add, test, and enable servers in [MCP](/docs/integrations/mcp) and [MCP Settings](/docs/settings/mcp).
- Configure external messaging in [Channels](/docs/integrations/channels) and service authorisation in [Accounts And Authorisation](/docs/integrations/accounts).

# Operations, Data, And Recovery

Row-Bot is local-first, so operational safety starts with knowing which data directory and workspace are active. Conversations, settings, memory, Knowledge, workflows, documents, Designer projects, Developer workspace records, skills, plugins, logs, channel state, and MCP configuration can live under that directory. Operating-system key stores may hold credentials separately.

## Remote Access And Server Operations

Use [Remote Access And Server Mode](/docs/operations/remote-access) for the complete guide to one-time invitations, desktop and compact owner sessions, Tailscale Serve, LAN, SSH forwarding, Docker, HTTPS reverse proxies, browser-local voice, access recovery, and proxy error diagnostics.

Use [Docker And VPS Operations](/docs/operations/docker) for pull-first Compose startup, release and digest pins, persistent volumes, offline backup and restore, explicit upgrade and rollback, host Caddy or Tailscale, secret-file mounts, and container-specific Developer boundaries.

Remote access remains off by default in ordinary desktop launches. Server operators should back up access state with the rest of the active data directory, keep one worker, publish one canonical origin, terminate remote traffic with HTTPS, and trust only the exact reverse proxy that connects to Row-Bot.

## Back Up

1. Open Settings and note the active data and workspace paths.
2. Stop running workflows, channels, servers, and active generations.
3. Close Row-Bot so databases are not changing during the copy.
4. Copy the whole active data directory to protected storage.
5. Back up external workspaces, exported Designer files, and Wiki vaults separately when they live elsewhere.
6. Record the Row-Bot version used with the backup.

## Restore

Restore related databases and files as one set while Row-Bot is closed. Point a test launch at the restored directory first, then check conversations, providers, workflows, Knowledge, documents, Designer, Developer, plugins, MCP, and channels. Reconnect secrets that were stored in an OS keychain and were not included in the file backup.

## Update, Repair, And Uninstall

Use the supported package or updater flow for your platform. Back up before a major update. Repair may replace application files but should not be treated as a data backup. Uninstalling the application and deleting the local data directory are separate decisions; review both the application location and the data location before removal.

## Logs And Support

Use Monitor and the local log folder to diagnose startup, provider, workflow, channel, and background failures. Before sharing diagnostics, remove names, paths, account identifiers, document content, prompts, message content, tokens, and screenshots that expose private data.

## Release-Specific Manual Checks

Installer UX, upgrade, repair, uninstall, Windows signing, macOS notarisation, native file dialogs, OS permissions, and clean-machine behaviour require manual testing on release candidates. A successful docs build does not prove those native flows are release-ready.

# Troubleshooting

Start with the visible status text in Row-Bot. Then check the relevant Settings tab and Monitor. Most issues fall into one of four categories: setup is incomplete, a provider or tool is disabled, the wrong model is selected, or Row-Bot is waiting for approval.

## Setup Problems

- Reopen Setup Center if first launch was skipped or incomplete.
- Check Settings -> Providers and Settings -> Models before troubleshooting Chat.
- Check Settings -> System if local files, browser automation, command execution, or tunnels are involved.
- For native application control, open the Computer Use setup card and resolve its driver or operating-system permission status before retrying.

## Model Problems

- Refresh Providers, then refresh Models.
- Choose a tool-capable model for workflows, Designer, Developer, and multi-step tool use.
- For local and custom endpoints, use enough context for Row-Bot's instructions and tool schemas.
- If reasoning choices are missing, rejected, or reset, use the active model's conditional control or `/reasoning`, then follow [Reasoning Controls](/docs/chat/reasoning-controls#troubleshooting).

## Chat And Tool Problems

- Check the model picker, Agent Profile, approval mode, and enabled tools.
- If an action is waiting, review the thread approval prompt or open Activity Center.
- Ask Row-Bot to explain the last tool result if the transcript is unclear.
- If Computer Use is paused, choose Resume only after reviewing the target; if its lease is busy, stop or finish the active native task first.

## Workflow Problems

- Confirm the workflow is not paused.
- Run it manually once before trusting a schedule.
- Check delivery defaults and channel status.

## Designer And Developer Problems

- Designer: add a clearer goal, audience, references, or brand details.
- Developer: confirm a workspace is open before asking for code actions.
- Review commands and patches before approving or importing changes.

## Knowledge And Monitor Problems

- If Knowledge is empty, enable memory or index documents.
- If a record is wrong, edit or remove it.
- Use Monitor logs, extraction journal, dream journal, and View Full Log for background issues.

## Integrations

- Channels need credentials, optional tunnel setup, start/stop state, and user pairing.
- MCP needs the global switch, a trusted server, and a successful test.
- Plugins need installation, enablement, configuration, and sometimes a restart.
- Skills need to be enabled and relevant to the prompt.

## Remote Access And Server Mode

- If the browser shows `untrusted_forwarding_headers`, a proxy supplied forwarding metadata from an address Row-Bot does not trust. Restart after enabling a Row-Bot-owned Tailscale route. For another proxy, configure only its exact connecting address or CIDR; do not trust a broad network.
- If the browser shows `unexpected_host`, add the exact canonical browser-facing host and verify the proxy preserves it.
- If an invitation cannot be claimed, create it for the exact scheme, host, and port currently used by that browser. Expired, consumed, and stale-route invitations must be recreated.
- If Tailscale reports a conflict, Funnel, or an unowned route, inspect that configuration manually. Row-Bot deliberately refuses to reset or overwrite it.
- If a remote microphone is unavailable, use `localhost` or HTTPS, grant browser permission, and install the local voice model explicitly.
- Use `?mobile=1` for compact presentation or `?mobile=0` for desktop presentation. Switching layout does not change the session or its owner authority.
- Run `row-bot access doctor` for a secret-free server and route safety report.

The full route, authentication, Docker, proxy, and recovery guidance is in [Remote Access And Server Mode](/docs/operations/remote-access).

## Voice And Buddy

- Check microphone/output device selection and permissions.
- Use Dictate before Talk if you need review.
- Check provider readiness for realtime voice.
- If docked Buddy is missing, enable Show Buddy. If a torn-off overlay was hidden, use the tray's Show Buddy action.
- Drag Buddy itself out of the sidebar in the native Windows or macOS app; browser/server and compact mobile surfaces cannot create the native overlay.
- Use Open full thread for Talk, Dictate, complex approvals, attachments, tool traces, and complete history.

# Models And Providers

Providers are where models come from. Models are the specific choices you use in Chat, workflows, Designer, Developer, voice, and other Row-Bot surfaces.

To understand what leaves the app, when tools run, and where approvals fit, read [How A Request Runs](/docs/concepts/request-lifecycle).

## Recommended Setup Order

1. Open Settings -> Providers.
2. Connect one provider path.
3. Refresh provider health.
4. Open Settings -> Models.
5. Refresh the catalog.
6. Choose a default model.
7. Pin Quick Choices.
8. Test in Chat.

## Choosing A Provider Path

Use local Ollama for local-first privacy and no provider billing. Use an API provider for strong hosted models. Use a subscription account when you already have the supported provider account. Use a custom endpoint for advanced local or self-hosted OpenAI-compatible runtimes.

## Choosing Models

Keep at least one everyday chat model and one stronger tool-capable model pinned. For Developer, Designer, workflows, and complex tools, choose a model that can handle tool calls and enough context.

For models with exact reasoning capabilities, Row-Bot exposes a per-thread [Reasoning control](/docs/chat/reasoning-controls) with only the efforts, toggle, or token-budget choices that model supports. Provider default remains available as the compatibility-safe option.

For Ollama, Row-Bot prefers explicit tool-calling metadata, then the daemon's reported capability list. A reported `tools` capability enables agent use even for a model family newer than Row-Bot's maintained fallback catalogue; an explicit capability list that omits `tools` remains authoritative. Family fallbacks are used only when the daemon provides no capability metadata.

## Troubleshooting

- If a provider connects but has no models, refresh Models.
- If a model fails with tools, choose a tool-capable model.
- If an Ollama model is unexpectedly excluded from agent use, refresh the local catalogue and inspect the capabilities reported by the installed Ollama daemon.
- If a custom endpoint fails, check base URL, model name, API compatibility, and context window.
