# Row-Bot - Release Notes

---

## v5.1.0 - Apps & Skills, Fewer Approvals & Fixes From Real Use

This release brings every way Row-Bot reaches another service into one place.
Settings › Apps and Settings › Skills replace Integrations, MCP, Plugins,
Accounts and Channels: a catalog worth browsing, one card per app with its ways
to connect, one consent, and a clear choice of what each app may do. Apps then
work where you do: switch them per conversation, mention them, connect one from
a card when the work needs it, see each app's name and logo on its steps and
approvals, and use apps in workflows. The Developer panel asks for fewer
approvals without asking for less, shell commands can no longer touch Row-Bot's
own data, and browser voice uses the speech models you chose. A long round of
fixes from recording demos and from using the desktop app as a person would
comes with it: retry in place, delete with Undo, plainer words, and many broken
or confusing moments made right. Your apps, skills, packages, sign-ins and
channels carry over from 5.0. Read **Upgrade Notes** below before upgrading.

### Apps And Skills In One Place

- **One catalog** - Settings › Apps opens on your apps, then featured apps from
  their vendors (about 100, such as GitHub, Notion, Linear, Atlassian, Stripe,
  Sentry, Supabase and Figma), then the whole official MCP Registry (about
  40,000 records), mirrored on this computer so search is instant and works
  offline. Catalogs update only when you ask, in the background, and a failed
  update keeps the last good copy.
- **Find by the job** - search for an app or for what you want done ("send
  email"), or browse by category. Vendors come before the community, and one
  card stands for each app with all its ways to connect.
- **Ways to connect** - sign in, paste a key, run a program on this computer,
  or use a way built into Row-Bot. Sign-in follows what the service supports:
  Row-Bot's published client document, registration, or your own OAuth app. A
  link or a downloaded bundle can be added from "Add from link or file".
- **One consent** - one sheet says what will happen, where requests go and
  what is saved. An app you sign in to then asks what it can do: Look things
  up (where the service offers it, Row-Bot asks for read access only) or Look
  things up and make changes; other apps choose Read only, Ask before changes
  or Full access. Changes always ask first unless you choose Full access, and
  each tool can be set on its own. A read stays a read: a tool whose name says
  it reads is never treated as a change because of its description.
- **Your apps** - Settings › Apps shows what is connected and what needs you
  (sign in again, add a key, finish setup, turn on), and Home's Needs you lists
  apps waiting on a sign-in, a key or a fix. Turn off stops an app's
  connection at once, Remove can also delete its saved keys and data, a change
  left unfinished can be found and settled, and one Use apps switch stops every
  app everywhere.
- **Skills** - Settings › Skills lists your skills and featured skills from
  official and maintainer repositories, added from their source after a look at
  what they contain (scripts never run when a skill is added). A skill made for
  an app says "Works with GitHub" and whether that app is connected, and an
  app's page lists its skills. Skills go by their own names.
- **Accounts, channels and key tools are apps** - Google (with a step-by-step
  guide that links to each page it needs), X, Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord,
  Slack and SMS, web search and Wolfram Alpha are built-in ways to connect,
  edited in their own pages. Setup Center offers Apps and Skills.
- **Packages** - Hermes recipes and Row-Bot marketplace packages are reviewed
  before they connect, show what they run and may do before they are added,
  and can't grant themselves access.

### Apps In Conversations

- **Choose per conversation** - + › Apps switches an app on or off for one
  conversation; @app keeps a turn to the apps you name; /skill loads a skill
  for the turn. All stay within the conversation's agent profile.
- **Suggested in place** - when the work needs an app you haven't connected,
  the conversation shows a Connect card from Row-Bot's own catalog, never a
  download suggested by a web page. An app you added but turned off offers Turn
  on; one that only looks things up offers Allow changes when the work is a
  change; an app switched off in the conversation is named as off instead of
  worked around.
- **Named on every step** - tool steps and approvals show the app's name and
  logo, and approvals read their arguments in words.
- **Interactive app views** - apps that offer MCP Apps views can show them in
  the conversation, in a sandboxed frame, behind the same approvals, following
  the page's theme.
- **Workflows with apps** - workflow steps name the apps they use and discover
  app tools as conversations do; an app's locked tools always ask; templates
  such as a GitHub pull-request digest and a daily brief from the web start
  from Workflows.
- **Windows connectors** - on Windows builds with the On-device Agent Registry,
  its connectors appear as a catalog.
- **Composio (optional)** - a separate hosted service that connects many apps
  through one Composio account. It is off until you read its disclosure and
  turn it on in Apps › Advanced.

### Developer, Shell And Approvals

- **Fewer approvals** - one "Apply the sandbox changes?" card applies every
  pending sandbox change, oldest first, and "Approve the rest" covers later
  actions of the same kind until the reply ends, for local code-folder work
  only (edits, branches, commits, detected checks and plain commands). Push,
  pull requests, merges, reverts, deletes, installs, network actions and the
  Shell tool always ask.
- **Pull requests from the conversation** - Row-Bot can open a pull request
  for a code folder's branch with the GitHub CLI on this computer, as a draft
  by default and by the conversation's approval mode, with suggested text that
  describes the branch.
- **Commands are what they do** - a Developer command that isn't on a
  read-only list counts as running a command (Ask asks, Auto runs, Block
  refuses), and quoted code no longer hides what a command does. The Custom
  Tool Builder asks before it tests, sets up, creates, enables or promotes a
  tool.
- **Row-Bot's own data stays out of reach** - shell commands that name
  Row-Bot's data folder are refused, and file tools refuse paths inside it.
  "Let the agent read Row-Bot's data folder" in Settings › System makes such
  commands ask every time instead.
- **Developer panel** - confirmations appear beside the button that asked,
  earlier changes open their diff, sandbox changes import oldest first, change
  times read in words, counts agree, the panel refreshes after an agent run,
  new files read as added in Changes, and the Run tab says where commands
  Row-Bot runs for you appear.
- **Undo never deletes work** - Undo on a "Created code folder" card removes
  the folder only while it is still empty; once files are added it keeps them
  and says so. Undo on a "Created design" card asks first.

### Conversations, Goals And Agents

- **Retry in place** - Retry and Send again run the last message again in place
  instead of adding a second copy of it.
- **Delete with Undo** - deleting a conversation asks, then offers Undo for a
  few seconds; New chat reuses an empty conversation instead of making
  another, and never-used conversations stay out of the sidebar, Home and
  Recent.
- **Follow-ups** - a message typed while the previous one is being confirmed
  stays in the composer on its own instead of joining the sent text.
- **Goals** - answering a goal's question resumes the goal, Needs you lists
  goals waiting on you, goals name their conversation, and a goal shows as a
  small Set a goal until there is one.
- **Agents** - each agent describes itself in the + menu and the New chat menu;
  agent profile details read in words, with Show instructions (an owner-only
  read), editing a copy, and starter templates.
- **Long work** - long tool calls show progress, a provider that cuts a reply
  off is retried once, and provider streams check their limits once a second
  instead of on every chunk.

### Designs

- **Delete a design** - More design actions › Delete design… asks first and
  never deletes a conversation; conversations that used it keep their
  messages.
- **Templates that pass their own Review** - every template passes Review on
  its canvas and opens on the canvas it was made for; storyboard shots and
  phone screens fill their canvas; design chats suggest design work.
- **Fonts** - designs use the fonts bundled with Row-Bot, previews substitute a
  bundled face with a notice, and offline exports carry the design's own fonts
  instead of falling back to system fonts (and no longer warn about "pictures
  from the web" for them).
- **Export** - a landing page's PNG is the whole page; exported file names keep
  the design's punctuation; the Export panel collapses after saving; exporting
  without Browser Automation says so and links to its setup.
- **Writing designs** - `designer_set_brand` checks every value before saving,
  long pages can be written in parts, and approvals for design and workflow
  actions read in words.

### Knowledge, Memory, Documents And Tracker

- **Memory without the search model** - saving a memory works on a computer
  without the local search model; recall matches words until the model is
  downloaded and the index is built then. A second save of the same memory no
  longer fails, and adding a memory closes once saved.
- **Documents** - processing works on a fresh profile and from Settings without
  a conversation; a document that can't be processed says why and what to do;
  batches show their size and finish with errors you can clear.
- **Knowledge graph** - small graphs label every memory, graph labels stay
  clear of the toolbar, and expanded charts show the whole figure with
  readable tooltips.
- **Tracker** - Settings › Tracker opens a tracker's latest entries, deletes one
  tracker on its own, starts a tracker in a conversation, and logs several
  entries at once; an entry dated by its day reads as that day.
- **Search** - Library search follows your typing, finds today's conversations
  first and every title at once, and shows plain-text excerpts; Ctrl/Cmd+F
  finds within a conversation.

### Tools, Models And Voice

- **Tools** - `calculate` answers dates, weekdays, durations and text length;
  `read_url` reads PDFs; reminders can be set for an exact time.
- **Ollama** - Ollama's own capability report decides whether a model gets
  tools, vision and thinking.
- **Browser voice uses your models** - Talk and Dictation use the speech-to-text
  model chosen for each (Whisper or SenseVoice), a saved Whisper size,
  SenseVoice path or Kokoro voice and speed applies without a restart, a model
  that isn't ready says so, and Test voice plays in the browser instead of on
  the host's speaker.

### Settings, Home And Monitor

- **Plainer words** - settings, setup, search, approvals and errors use plain
  words; each approval mode says what it does; Home reads memory saves as
  updates.
- **Settings search** - lands on the setting, works from the keyboard, and
  finds settings by more names (for example API keys).
- **Home** - the health tile follows your actual setup (channels you didn't
  start, the first-run model), and the agents card opens the library when there
  is no agent to show.
- **Monitor** - warns when a development checkout serves a client older than
  its source.
- **Notices** - floating notices sit at the bottom centre, above the composer,
  the on-screen keyboard and the install or update notice, never over a page
  header.

### Devices, Browsers And Connections

- **Plain-HTTP network access works again** - a computer that opens Row-Bot at
  a plain `http://` network address can send messages and make changes again,
  not only read.
- **"Disconnected" means disconnected** - only a lost connection reads
  "Disconnected"; a fault in the app reads "Something went wrong", with
  details.
- **Install, update and offline notices** - no longer cover the composer, and
  Firefox and Safari no longer offer a false "Update and reload" on a first
  visit.
- **New windows aren't locked out** - after many sign-ins, the least recently
  used session gives way instead of refusing new windows.
- **Conversations deleted elsewhere** - a conversation deleted in another
  window goes Home with one notice; pinning is one tap; Close in Settings goes
  back to where you were.

### Reliability, Security And Privacy

- **Keys only in the keychain** - app keys and tokens, and Google and X
  sign-ins, are kept in the system keychain, never on command lines, in
  responses or in pasted settings; keys typed into a 5.0 server's headers or
  environment move into the keychain on upgrade, with no plaintext copy left.
- **Reviewed local installs** - local apps run from reviewed locks (npm without
  scripts, Python with hashed wheels, containers by digest, MCP bundles);
  desktop apps are checked first; bundles download only after consent and a
  matching SHA-256, and unpack privately; a restart stops orphaned app
  programs.
- **One safe fetch path** - catalog traffic, logos, previews and downloads
  reach only checked public addresses, honour the system proxy for reviewed
  hosts, never carry credentials to another host, and fall back to a host's
  next checked address when one doesn't answer.
- **Access that holds** - pasted configuration can't pre-approve tools, Auto
  never overrides an app's access, delegated agents keep the conversation's
  apps, and separate Google sign-ins are never merged. Row-Bot adds no
  telemetry.
- **Backups** - leave out upload staging files and name any file they couldn't
  read instead of failing.
- **Windows** - two uploads at once no longer deadlock, and skills, runtimes and
  settings retry while Windows briefly holds a file.
- **Dependency security updates** - pypdf 6.19.0 (eight advisories),
  hydra-core 1.3.7 (GHSA-mwj6-rfh8-7qf4, GHSA-rqx7-p7vv-w7hr,
  GHSA-c3wx-c55w-pxjq; thanks to @katsugtgz), langgraph-sdk 0.4.6
  (GHSA-fvww-7h3r-vfhp) and multidict 6.9.1 (GHSA-54p9-h82j-f925); in the
  WhatsApp bridge, music-metadata 11.16.1 and sharp 0.35.5.

### Testing, CI And Release Pipeline

- **No more stalls** - the test suite no longer stalls; flaky tests were fixed
  at their cause, and the few that couldn't be were removed with their
  coverage kept elsewhere.
- **All three browser engines** - the weekly Firefox and WebKit runs pass, and
  the apps and app-view journeys run nightly on their own server.
- **Live checks** - Notion, Linear, Atlassian, Sentry, Stripe (sandbox),
  Supabase, Context7, Playwright, GitHub and Composio were connected with real
  accounts and checked to read, refresh, turn off, disconnect and remove
  cleanly.
- **Clean security scan** - the OSV scan of every lock file passes, with narrow,
  dated exceptions only for docs-site build tools that have no compatible fix.

### Documentation And Website

- **User guide** - the Apps and Skills guides, apps in conversations, built-in
  ways to connect, Google setup, Windows connectors, Composio and workflows with
  apps.
- **Sign-in document** - Row-Bot's sign-in client document is published at
  `row-bot.ai/oauth/client-metadata.json`.
- **row-bot.ai** - the landing page's story shows the Row-Bot 5 React app, and
  Buddy is transparent on Safari, iPhone and iPad.
- **The assistant knows where things are** - Row-Bot's own feature guide points
  to 5.0's places (the Design panel, Home's tabs, the Settings pages) instead of
  the retired Studios and tabs.

### Upgrade Notes

- **Places that moved** - Settings › Integrations, MCP, Plugins, Accounts and
  Channels are now Settings › Apps and Settings › Skills. Old links, including
  5.0.0's, open the matching page.
- **Everything carries over** - MCP servers, plugins and packages, skills,
  sign-ins and channels from 5.0 appear in Apps and Skills with their settings
  and access.
- **Access you set stays** - a connection saved before this release keeps any
  tool it recorded as asking first. To use 5.1's finer read classification for
  an app, remove it and connect it again.
- **Shell commands and the data folder** - commands that name Row-Bot's data
  folder are now refused; turn on "Let the agent read Row-Bot's data folder" in
  Settings › System if a workflow relied on it (they then ask every time).
- **Developer commands ask more honestly** - commands that aren't on the
  read-only list now ask in Ask mode and are refused in Block mode.
- **Composio is off** until you turn it on.

### Known Issues And Deferred Work

- The Slack app (search and read Slack from a conversation) connects only
  through your own Slack app; the Slack channel for talking to Row-Bot is
  unchanged.
- Composio keeps its grant after you remove it in Row-Bot; revoke it in your
  Composio account.
- Windows connectors need a Windows build that includes the On-device Agent
  Registry.
- Deleting a conversation is sent when its Undo notice ends; closing the window
  first keeps the conversation.
- A conversation counts as never used by its title, so one whose first message
  is exactly "New conversation" is left out of the sidebar and Home (it stays in
  the Library).
- A design with a brand on a system font (such as Georgia) still warns about
  web assets when exported offline.

## v5.0.0 - New React App, Conversation-First Workspace & One-Click Fixes

This major release replaces Row-Bot's NiceGUI interface with one React app
and rebuilds the workspace around the conversation. Designs, code folders,
goals, delegated agents, approvals and the terminal now live with the
conversation that uses them; Home opens on an Overview of what needs you; a
fresh profile asks one question, "How should Row-Bot think?", and never runs
on a model you didn't choose. Approvals can be answered wherever you are,
Monitor keeps its checks and offers one fix per problem, phones and other
computers connect with a self-renewing QR code, and your profile can be backed
up and restored. Underneath, the server is plain FastAPI run by uvicorn, about
65,000 lines of NiceGUI-era code are gone, and the test and release pipeline
runs each genuine test once. Local-first defaults, approval gates and the
single-owner access model are unchanged. Read **Upgrade Notes And Breaking
Changes** below before upgrading.

### One App, Rebuilt In React

- **React is the only interface** - the desktop window, browsers, phones,
  tablets and server mode all open the same React app at `/app-v2/`. `/`
  redirects there and keeps its query string; a remote browser without a
  session goes to `/connect` first.
- **Plain FastAPI server** - the app server is a FastAPI app run by uvicorn,
  using HTTP and server-sent events only (no WebSockets). Start-up, shutdown
  and cleanup keep their order, responses are compressed and the event stream
  is never compressed or buffered. NiceGUI and 16 locked packages left the
  dependency set.
- **Background work sees what you are doing** - Dream Cycle, memory
  extraction, checkpoint and thread cleanup, browser tab eviction and the
  status tool now see turns running in the app, and sending a message or
  opening a conversation marks you active, so background jobs wait while you
  work and never extract from the conversation you have open.
- **One launcher per data folder** - starting Row-Bot again from a shortcut
  while it runs brings the running app forward instead of starting a second
  instance against the same profile.
- **Reconnects by itself** - after a server restart or a lost connection, open
  windows reconnect, reopen the conversation and keep unsent drafts, with
  Reconnect offered instead of a dead end.
- **Errors that say what to do** - every server error reads as one sentence
  with at most one fix (Retry, Reconnect, Choose a model, open the exact
  setting, or Send now); an unexpected one shows its code under Details.
- **Quiet background notices** - plugin load failures, tunnel start-up
  failures and token warnings arrive as short floating notices, once per
  device per start, and start-up warnings are listed in Monitor.
- **A desktop window that behaves like an app** - native windows get a
  right-click menu (Cut, Copy, Paste, Select All, never on password fields),
  message text can be selected and copied, the Windows clipboard keeps accents
  intact, and exports and downloads use the native Save dialog and land where
  you chose.
- **Buddy desktop overlay in React** - the torn-off Buddy is now part of the
  React app: it follows the selected conversation's turns, drafts and
  approvals, docks back reliably, keeps its desktop features through long
  sessions, and places itself correctly on high-DPI and multi-monitor setups.
  The sidebar Buddy is larger and wears an activity ring.

### A Redesigned Workspace

- **Sidebar** - New chat (Mod+Shift+O) or a new chat with an agent, Home,
  Agents (favourite profiles start a chat in one click; All agents opens the
  profile library), and conversations by date with pinning and a type filter
  (All, Chats, Designs, Code, Workflows) that covers every conversation, not
  only the most recent pages. Settings and the attention indicator sit in the
  footer; the collapsed rail keeps every destination as a labelled icon.
- **Home** - five tabs: Overview, Workflows, Knowledge, Monitor and Insights.
  Overview greets you with Buddy and an Ask box, then Needs you (approvals,
  problems and setup, with their fixes in place), Continue where you left off,
  today's agents and workflow runs, Since yesterday evening, and Learned this
  week.
- **Conversation details card** - a floating card beside the chat shows what
  the conversation is Working on (designs, code folders, the browser), its
  goal, its outputs and its agents. Below desktop width it opens as a sheet.
- **A calmer transcript** - a centred reading column with speaker markers
  (your Buddy's image for Row-Bot, a person icon for you), one activity row
  per turn ("Used 3 tools · 1 failed") that expands into its steps,
  highlighted code with Copy and Download, tables that copy as CSV, citations
  as source chips, link chips, inline PDFs, generated media shown once, and
  agent runs marked where they start, finish or fail.
- **One composer field** - paste screenshots, drop files or pick several at
  once, with limits stated up front (25 MB a file, 32 files, 100 MB a
  message); attachments show as thumbnails with progress and Retry, and Send
  waits for uploads still running. `/goal`, `/reasoning`, `/profile` and
  `/agent` run with their argument, `@` mentions agent profiles, write targets
  and files, active skills show as chips, and Send turns into Stop.
- **Messages that wait their turn** - a message sent while Row-Bot works waits
  in one list above the composer with Send now, Edit and Discard; Stop pauses
  waiting messages, and nothing is ever sent twice.
- **Stop keeps what was written** - a stopped reply stays in the conversation
  with a Stopped marker, also after a reload.
- **Conversations name themselves** - a new conversation takes its first words
  at once and a short descriptive name after the first reply.
- **Command palette (Ctrl+K / ⌘K)** - one search across conversations
  (including message text), commands, settings and saved workflows. It
  understands plain intents in any word order ("connect a model", "turn on
  developer tools", "phone", "connect telegram", "dark mode"), lists settings
  switches as actions showing their current state with Undo, ranks message
  matches above scattered letter matches, lists the open design's commands,
  and Enter runs only a result that matches what you typed.
- **Library and conversation menus** - each conversation's menu pins,
  renames, exports as Markdown or PDF in one step, and deletes. The Library
  lists every conversation with type filters, search and multi-select (Select
  all, Clear all) to pin, export or delete many at once, with deletion
  progress shown. Deleting the open conversation keeps the app connected.
- **Appearance** - bundled Geist type, light and dark themes that follow the
  operating system until you choose, plus accent colour, density and reduce
  transparency in Settings › Appearance.
- **Phones and tablets** - phones get one header per page, a one-line
  composer, panels as full-screen sheets and 44 px touch targets throughout;
  tablets keep centred dialogs; Settings keeps its search at every width.

### First Run And Models

- **No preset models** - a fresh profile has no chat, vision, image or video
  model until you choose one; the built-in `qwen3:14b`, `gemma3:4b`,
  `gpt-image-1.5` and `veo-3.1` presets are gone. Channels, workflows, Dream
  Cycle, memory extraction, delegated agents and Buddy's Hatch wait or reply
  politely until a model is chosen, and removing a provider keeps your saved
  default (shown as unavailable) instead of falling back to another model.
- **"How should Row-Bot think?"** - the first run asks one question: On this
  computer (Ollama detected and re-checked automatically, with install steps
  for your operating system and your installed models listed), With my
  subscription (ChatGPT, Claude or Grok with a device code that is checked
  automatically), With an API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini and
  OpenRouter first, the rest under More providers; each key is checked before
  it is saved), or a custom endpoint. The pick becomes your default, a
  one-message test runs and Home opens; if another assistant's data is found,
  an import is offered. It replaces the setup wizard.
- **Setup Center** - the remaining areas live in Setup Center, which counts
  done and skipped areas separately and reads their real state.
- **An honest model pill** - the composer's model pill shows a local or cloud
  glyph, "Chat only", "Choose a model", or "Unavailable" with the reason and
  Reconnect or Choose another model. It never reads "Ready" for a model that
  cannot run.
- **One model list everywhere** - the composer and the Brain, Vision, Image
  and Video pickers share one grouped, searchable list with billing tags
  (Subscription, Pay per use, Credits, Local · free), so subscription models
  such as ChatGPT and Claude subscription models can be chosen as Brain and
  Vision. Vision defaults to "Same as chat model", and attaching an image to a
  model that can't see images says so and offers Choose a vision model.
- **Settings › Models** - rebuilt as plain rows with readable model names,
  labelled icon buttons and the default model renamed "Brain model".
- **Voice** - Settings › Voice installs Whisper at the chosen size, showing
  its download size and source first; Realtime Talk says it is paid per minute
  through OpenAI.
- **Custom endpoints** - refusals show inside the dialog, the list stays put
  while it refreshes, and an endpoint that doesn't answer reads Unavailable
  instead of waiting forever.

### Doing Things By Conversation

- **Designs and code folders on request** - ask for a deck or an app and the
  assistant creates the design or a code folder named after the request, then
  keeps working in it. A card in the transcript offers Open, Rename and Undo.
  Wording alone never creates or binds anything, and the old keyword-based
  setup before a turn is gone.
- **Existing folders and clones** - "use my <name> folder" binds a registered
  code folder by name, or offers Choose folder when none matches; "clone
  <address>" shows a clone card, you choose where it goes, and the
  conversation continues in the new folder. A "Using code folder" card offers
  Open and Undo, which unbinds the folder and keeps its files. The model never
  picks a path.
- **Setup cards** - when work needs a tool that is off, such as web search or
  Developer tools, the transcript asks "Turn on <tool>?" with Turn on and Not
  now through the approval-gated settings change; a missing account or channel
  shows a Connect card that opens its setup. Not now is final for that
  request.
- **Goals without a turn limit** - set a goal from the conversation details
  card or with `/goal`. It starts at once and continues after each turn until
  it is done, with no turn limit by default and optional turn and time limits.
  The goal card shows the turn, time running, tokens, the latest progress
  reason, Pause or Resume, and Stop.
- **Goals that know when to stop** - a goal pauses with its reason after two
  turns without progress or when the same step fails three times; it waits
  out a provider's rate or usage limit and continues when the limit resets
  (or pauses and says so when the provider gives no time); approvals pause it;
  a conversation's goal continues after Row-Bot restarts, while a channel goal
  pauses.
- **Delegated agents in reach** - every agent appears in the transcript as it
  starts, finishes or fails, and in the details card's Agents with Stop and
  Message. An agent's own conversation opens with "Task from the parent
  conversation" instead of its internal handoff prompt and offers a compact way
  back to the parent. Agent work interrupted by a restart can be resumed or
  dismissed.

### Approvals Answered Where You Are

- **One place for every approval** - approvals from workflows, other
  conversations and delegated agents appear in the attention indicator's list,
  in Overview's Needs you, as a floating notice and in Buddy, each with
  Approve and Deny in place. A delegated agent's approval can be answered in
  its own conversation or in the parent's.
- **Approvals wait until answered** - approvals no longer expire after 30
  minutes by default, and each shows how long it has waited. A timeout set
  explicitly on a workflow step still applies, and while a run waits, the same
  workflow's next scheduled run is skipped and says so.
- **Truthful outcomes** - a denied action ends the turn with your answer
  instead of letting the model try another way, its step reads as skipped
  rather than spinning, and tool results tell the model whether approval was
  needed, given or denied. Stop withdraws every approval the turn was waiting
  on.
- **Survives restarts** - a pending approval comes back with its card after a
  restart, and conversations waiting for one are marked in the sidebar.
  Ctrl+Enter approves only outside text fields.

### Design, Code, Terminal And Computer Use Panels

- **Design panel** - a design opens in its conversation's Design panel: a
  canvas with a page strip, Edit with an inspector that uses font and logo
  pickers instead of raw fields, drafting from a brief in one step with
  "Drafting · …" progress, add and delete pages with Undo, a Size menu (16:9,
  4:3, 1:1, A4, 9:16 phone) that re-fits every page, full-screen Present,
  Review with per-issue Fix and "Fix all safe issues", brand colours and fonts
  "From a website", and Duplicate.
- **Export and publish** - Export is four format buttons; on this computer one
  click saves into the workspace's Exports folder with Open and Show in
  folder. Publish asks once, then Share shows the link with Copy, Open, a QR
  code drawn locally, and Unpublish.
- **Developer panel** - a code folder opens in its conversation's Developer
  panel with a status strip (folder and branch) and Changes, Files, Run and
  Git tabs; it opens on Changes when there are some and reads the folder
  afresh each time. Shell operators such as `&&` and `|` are explained before
  a command is sent, Stop all processes ends everything the folder started,
  and a missing or signed-out GitHub CLI shows the Connect GitHub card.
- **Custom tools** - Settings › Tools lists custom tools with add from a
  folder, Test, on and off, and remove; test commands that need approval use
  the standard approval card.
- **Interactive terminal** - in the desktop app, a real terminal docks under
  the conversation: keystrokes, colours, history, tab completion, Ctrl+C and
  Stop, a resizable height remembered per device, Ctrl+` to show or hide it,
  and a full-screen sheet on phones. "Open in your terminal" opens your own
  terminal app at the code folder without Row-Bot's keys in its environment.
- **Computer use card** - a Computer Use turn shows "Using your computer" with
  the app, the latest picture (kept in memory only), Pause to take over,
  Resume and Stop.

### Workflows

- **Run in one click** - Run starts a workflow at once and the run drawer
  follows it live until "Run finished"; New workflow opens on the page, like
  Edit; Overview offers "Run <name> again" for a failed run.
- **Clearer editor** - "Send results to" is In this app plus a checklist of
  your configured channels, prefilled from your defaults; agent profile and
  model pickers; Duplicate (the copy starts switched off, without a
  schedule); typing `{{` suggests date variables and earlier steps' results;
  leaving with unsaved changes asks first; a one-off time that has already
  passed is refused.
- **Webhook triggers** - the trigger shows its address with Copy and the
  secret sent as the `X-Row-Bot-Webhook-Secret` header, plus an explicit
  "Make reachable from the internet" that asks first.
- **Honest run history** - runs that a previous process left unfinished are
  settled as stopped at start-up instead of reading "running" for months.

### Knowledge And Memory

- **Knowledge graph** - Home › Knowledge draws the graph with WebGL and lets
  it settle visibly, shows up to 2,000 memories by default and up to 5,000
  with Show all, and searches the whole library.
- **Everything about memories in one place** - status and type filters, the
  Review queue, bulk select and delete, full details, Add memory and the
  activity logs moved into Knowledge; Settings › Memory keeps the settings.
- **Reliable recall with parallel agents** - recalling a memory no longer
  counts as a change to it, so agents recalling at the same time keep using
  semantic recall instead of falling back to word search, and recalls no
  longer rewrite wiki vault files.
- **Readable wiki vault names** - articles keep readable `<Subject>.md` names
  under an ownership manifest, so the app only writes or removes articles it
  created. A renamed memory's article is renamed with it, a clash gets a short
  suffix instead of overwriting anything, and the vault status reads quickly
  on large vaults.
- **Document processing model** - documents are processed with the "Model for
  documents" chosen beside the queue rather than the last conversation's
  model.
- **Clearer relation editing** - vague relation types are refused with an
  explanation before anything is saved.

### Monitor, Insights And One-Click Fixes

- **Checks that run and are kept** - Monitor's local checks run shortly after
  start and every 15 minutes; connection checks (Ollama, the Google, X and
  GitHub sign-ins, and internet reachability) run hourly while "Check
  connections every hour" is on, and whenever you ask. Results are kept with
  their time, so tiles no longer fall back to "Not checked".
- **A fix for every problem** - each warning or failure comes with one fix on
  Monitor's tiles, its detail drawer, Needs attention and Overview: restart a
  stopped channel, renew a Google or X sign-in, choose the default model, open
  the exact Settings row, or check again.
- **Attention indicator** - a sidebar indicator appears only when something
  needs you (a problem, an approval or an update) and stays quiet otherwise;
  an update offer can be put off with Remind me later.
- **Honest Insights** - review-only proposals offer no Apply, an applied
  proposal says what it did, and each insight records the model that found it
  and says when it may be out of date.

### Devices And Remote Access

- **Devices & remote access** - the Settings page that replaces Remote Access.
  Connect a phone or computer detects the ways in (Tailscale, Same Wi-Fi, or
  the internet through your public link), shows one QR code backed by a
  one-time, 10-minute invitation that renews itself, waits for the device and
  then shows Connected with Rename and how to install Row-Bot on that phone.
- **Your devices** - each device with "This device", when and where it was
  last seen in words, Rename, and Sign out, which ends every session of that
  device.
- **Advanced** - where Row-Bot listens, one list of allowed addresses applied
  live, the Tailscale share with Stop sharing, the tunnel provider and token,
  and one Public line with the address, Copy and Stop.
- **Sessions renew themselves** - invited devices renew their session in the
  app and never revive a revoked one. Tailscale's own consent page is linked
  when it asks, a Serve conflict comes with next steps, and Same Wi-Fi is
  offered only while Row-Bot listens on the network.
- **Tunnels never outlive Row-Bot** - tunnels close on every exit, agents a
  crash left behind are stopped at the next start, agents Row-Bot didn't start
  are never touched, and Devices & remote access and Monitor report the real
  tunnel state.
- **SMS and plugin webhooks through the tunnel** - Twilio messages and plugin
  webhooks reach Row-Bot through the public link and are checked by their own
  Twilio signature or webhook secret; every other route still needs a
  session.

### Connections, Plugins, MCP And Skills

- **One connect sheet** - Telegram, Slack, Discord, SMS, WhatsApp, Google, X,
  GitHub and plugin setup each use numbered steps with links. Channels add
  "Send a test message to me" (confirmed, one message to your own account),
  WhatsApp shows its live QR code and Reset session, a channel that needs a
  public address opens the tunnel and shows "Reachable at <address>", and X
  shows its callback address with Copy.
- **Accounts that agree with Monitor** - one GitHub status shared with
  Monitor, stored Check results, and Google's short-lived access tokens and
  X's expiry read correctly.
- **Reviewed plugin changes** - install, update, prepare and uninstall show a
  review (version, source, checksum, permissions and disclosures) and run only
  after you confirm. Marketplace downloads require the index's checksum and
  verify it, remote index entries download their source archive, plugins that
  run in their own worker get a reviewed Prepare step, and a plugin that fails
  to load says so.
- **MCP servers** - Add a server takes arguments one per line and environment
  values and headers as masked name and value rows; "Add and connect" saves,
  tests, accepts tools, turns the server on and connects, stopping at the
  first step that needs you. Enable in chat is on the MCP page, the Node.js
  runtime install recovers from an interrupted install, and saved servers
  connect reliably.
- **Skills** - public skill search answers quickly (GitHub keyword search uses
  the browse index, sources are read in parallel and partial results show as
  they arrive); a skill opens in its own dialog with Install, and new skills
  are available in chats by default. Skills created or edited in Settings
  reach the agent without a restart.

### Settings And Your Data

- **Settings regrouped** - six groups (General, Models, Knowledge,
  Capabilities, Connections, System) with 19 pages and a search over pages
  and individual rows.
- **Saved as you go, with Undo** - every field saves at once and shows "Saved
  · Undo"; the Save and Revert buttons are gone except for typed credentials
  and editors such as a custom endpoint or MCP server. Unbinding a resource and
  dismissing an insight can be undone too, and Settings shows times, states
  and names in words rather than raw dates and ids.
- **Back up and restore** - Settings › Data › Back up now writes one zip to
  the workspace's Backups folder, without keys, sign-ins, sessions, caches,
  logs or runtimes, with webhook secrets and MCP headers and environment
  values blanked, and lists what to set up again. Restore from backup, in the
  desktop app, checks the archive (a foreign, newer or unsafe one is refused),
  applies it at the next start, keeps the current profile aside in
  `before-restore-<time>` and rolls back if anything fails.
- **Export conversations** - as Markdown or PDF. The PDF is printed offline in
  Chromium with scripts off and every request refused, or as a text PDF when
  Chromium isn't installed.
- **Import from another assistant** - Hermes Agent and OpenClaw data is found
  in its usual folder or picked in the desktop app, with Select all and Clear
  all.
- **Tidier data folder** - start-up removes temporary and splash files
  Row-Bot itself left behind, by exact name pattern and age only.

### Reliability, Security And Privacy Fixes

- **Webhook secrets** - compared in constant time; a workflow whose saved
  secret is empty no longer runs for any caller; the secret can travel in a
  header instead of the address, while existing `?secret=` addresses keep
  working and a request carrying two different secrets runs nothing.
- **No secrets in logs** - MCP server environment values and headers are no
  longer written to `row_bot.log` in plain text.
- **Windows credential storage** - when Credential Manager can't store more
  secrets, keys and sign-ins are saved as Windows-protected (DPAPI) records
  for your user instead of failing; Row-Bot never falls back to plain text.
- **Windows upgrades** - the installer replaces the application's source
  folder, so an upgrade never leaves a removed module behind.
- **Stopping commands on Windows** - Stop ends workspace commands started from
  a source checkout instead of leaving them running.
- **Workflow fixes** - double-encoded characters in new workflows and run
  titles are fixed, and a past one-off schedule no longer fires on save.
- **Approval monitor** - an agent approval that timed out no longer locks the
  database every minute.
- **Windows file locks** - provider settings, the wiki manifest and the
  document index retry while Windows briefly holds a file that was just
  written.
- **OpenCode Go** - requests no longer fail with "missing x-opencode-session":
  Row-Bot now names itself and sends the session id OpenCode Go requires on
  every model route. The id is a private value per conversation, never the
  conversation's own id. OpenCode Zen requests carry the same headers.
- **OpenRouter attribution** - OpenRouter requests, from chat and document
  processing alike, now identify Row-Bot as the app (its website address and
  name, as OpenRouter asks apps to) instead of LangChain, which lets OpenRouter
  show Row-Bot in its public app rankings. No user, prompt or account data is
  added.
- **Dependency security updates** - anyio 4.14.2 (fixing a critical
  advisory), soupsieve 2.10, and image-size 2.0.4 in the client toolchain.

### Testing, CI And Release Pipeline

- **One test pass per pull request** - CI runs the deterministic suite once,
  sharded on Linux, beside static checks, the client checks, a Windows (Python
  3.13) and macOS platform lane and a Chromium browser smoke, with one
  `CI / ci-ok` result; slow tests run nightly.
- **Nightly and weekly runs** - the full suite with slow tests on Linux,
  Windows and macOS, the browser nightly set at desktop and phone sizes, a
  Linux package smoke and the docs reference check; installer verification
  and Firefox and WebKit smokes weekly.
- **Release gate** - a release refuses a commit without a green `CI / ci-ok`,
  runs the nightly suite only if that commit has no green nightly run, and
  each Windows and macOS build install-smokes its own package.
- **Genuine tests only** - a guard fails any deterministic test that reaches
  the network, a missing snapshot fails instead of being recorded, the strict
  app smoke requires `/` to reach the React app, and low-value and
  bookkeeping tests were removed.

### Documentation And Website

- **Public docs for the new app** - the user guide describes the React app,
  with screenshots captured from it, and the generated reference pages read
  the client's settings pages and Home tabs directly.
- **row-bot.ai** - a redesigned landing page with product demos.
- **Developer docs** - `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, the architecture,
  source layout and client platform guides describe the React client, the
  FastAPI server and the new test lanes.

### Upgrade Notes And Breaking Changes

- **NiceGUI is gone** - the old interface and its routes are removed.
  `--legacy-ui` and `--client-v2` are deprecated no-ops that log a warning and
  open the React app. Bookmarks to `/` keep working; addresses that only the
  old interface served open Home.
- **Places that moved** - designs and code folders are conversations with a
  Design or Developer panel (Home's Designer and Developer tabs and the
  separate studios are gone); the Activity Center is replaced by the
  attention indicator, Overview's Needs you and the conversation details card;
  agent profiles live in the sidebar's Agents dialog; Settings › Utilities is
  now Settings › Tools; Remote Access is Settings › Devices & remote access;
  Google is under Accounts; migration is under Data; goals are set in the
  conversation. Old Settings links redirect to the new pages.
- **Memory editing moved** - the memory list, Review queue and editing are in
  Home › Knowledge; Settings › Memory keeps memory on and off, extraction,
  graph health, the wiki vault and Delete all knowledge.
- **Models after upgrading** - a profile that finished setup on an earlier
  version keeps the models it was effectively using: the old presets it ran
  on are written once as its own choices. Values you saved are never changed.
  A new profile chooses its first model in the first run.
- **Developer tools turned on once** - the Developer tool was off by default
  in earlier versions and saved settings kept that default. The first start of
  5.0.0 turns it on once and says so ("Developer tools are now on · Settings ›
  Tools"); if you want it off, turn it off again and it stays off. Its actions
  keep their approval gates.
- **Wiki vault tidy** - the first sync after upgrading adopts existing
  articles in place, under the same names, so Obsidian links keep working.
  Vaults written by pre-release builds with `entity-<hash>.md` names get one
  readable article per memory, and the hashed copies move to
  `raw/.row-bot-retired/hashed-names-<date>/`. Nothing is deleted, and
  hand-edited old articles are left alone and listed for review.
- **Approvals and goals** - new approvals wait until answered (existing
  pending approvals keep their expiry); new goals have no turn limit (existing
  goals keep theirs).
- **Webhook workflows** - a webhook workflow whose saved secret is empty no
  longer runs; save its trigger again to generate a secret. Prefer sending the
  secret in the `X-Row-Bot-Webhook-Secret` header.
- **Hourly connection checks** - Monitor checks connections hourly by default:
  Ollama, the Google, X and GitHub sign-ins, and internet reachability (a
  connection to 1.1.1.1 on port 53). Turning off "Check connections every
  hour" in Monitor stops them, along with the periodic account sign-in checks.
- **Plugins** - marketplace plugins without a checksum in their index can no
  longer be downloaded; a plugin that runs in its own worker and reads "Needs
  preparing" needs Prepare once.
- **Reverse proxies** - the app uses no WebSockets; keep the event stream
  (`/api/v1/events`, `text/event-stream`) unbuffered. The Caddy example drops
  `stream_close_delay`. The old interface's internal routes (`/_nicegui…`,
  `/_media/`, `/api/voice/local`, `/api/client-error`) are gone; scripts use
  the authenticated `/api/v1` API.
- **Dropped features** - plain-text conversation export (Markdown and PDF
  remain), Realtime voice diagnostics, the Designer's zero-state quick
  actions, its separate command palette (⌘K lists design commands) and its
  references list (the conversation's attachments are the references).
- **Running from source** - the app serves the built client from
  `frontend/dist`; build it once with Node.js 24.15 or later and npm 11
  (`npm ci` then `npm run build` in `frontend/`). Installers and Docker images
  already contain the built client.
- **New files in the data folder** - `launcher.lock` (held while Row-Bot runs),
  `system_health.json` (Monitor's kept checks), backup state, and
  `before-restore-<time>` folders after a restore.

### Known Issues And Deferred Work

- **Subscription sign-ins will change** - the ChatGPT subscription sign-in
  will be reworked, and Claude subscription is planned to move to the Claude
  Agent SDK using your own Claude Code sign-in, in later releases; 5.0.0 keeps
  the current sign-ins. Image generation through the ChatGPT subscription is
  not offered, because OpenAI's route for outside apps doesn't support it.
- **Stop and delegated agents** - stopping a turn doesn't stop the delegated
  agents that turn started; stop them from the details card's Agents.
- **No system notification for approvals yet** - a waiting approval shows in
  the app, as a floating notice and in Buddy, but not as an operating-system
  notification when the window isn't focused.
- **Goal cost** - the goal card shows tokens but not cost for pay-per-use
  models.
- **Private GitHub clones** - cloning a private repository in conversation
  with your connected GitHub account comes in a later release.
- **Buddy Hatch** - Hatch doesn't show its model and number of calls before
  generating, and a missing image model gives a generic error; both come with
  the Buddy revamp after this release.
- **Wiki vault recovery folder** - the vault's recovery folder keeps every
  retained version and candidate link; there is no pruning yet.
- **Voice** - Talk shows a generic message for transcription failures such as
  a missing ffmpeg (Dictate names the problem), and voice mode doesn't speak
  the combined answer of an agent orchestration.
- **Smaller items** - renaming a custom endpoint shows it unchecked until its
  next check, and a workflow run that asks for a second approval after an
  approved step can read "running" while it waits.

## v4.9.1 - Optional Computer Use Verification & Calculator Reliability

This patch release builds on v4.9.0 with a focused Computer Use setup fix. A
successful Cua Driver integrity check and diagnostic run now establish
readiness directly, while the visible Calculator launch remains available as
an optional confidence check. This prevents a fresh Windows installation from
being held in an incomplete setup state or raising `Called get_config outside
of a runnable context` when the driver reports Calculator by its canonical
Windows application name.

- **Diagnostics-based readiness** - treats successful managed-runtime or
  reviewed system-Cua diagnostics as the readiness boundary, without requiring
  a separate application launch before Computer Use can be enabled.
- **Optional Calculator verification** - keeps **Test with Calculator
  (optional)** as a secondary settings action for users who want an additional
  visible check, rather than presenting it as a setup or agent-use gate.
- **Canonical Windows app handling** - runs the settings-owned Calculator probe
  under its explicit local-UI approval path, so a returned `Windows Calculator`
  identity cannot fall through to an agent-graph approval interrupt outside an
  active runnable context.
- **Clearer setup recovery** - keeps Check setup as the primary degraded-state
  action and reports a successful optional probe as a test result without
  changing the underlying diagnostic record.
- **Regression and documentation coverage** - adds deterministic coverage for
  managed and system-Cua readiness without an observation marker, canonical
  Calculator identity handling, settings-state actions, and the regenerated
  public reference/search artifacts.

### Breaking Changes And Caveats

- No application-data migration, public CLI change, Cua Driver upgrade, new
  telemetry disclosure, or additional download is introduced by v4.9.1.
- Computer Use remains beta, local-interactive-only, off by default, and gated
  by the existing disclosure, reviewed runtime verification, diagnostics,
  platform permissions, and task-scoped safety policy. The optional Calculator
  probe does not replace an end-to-end task test on the applications a user
  actually intends to automate.

## v4.9.0 - Native Computer Use, Desktop Buddy & Safe Conversation Cleanup

This release builds on v4.8.0 with a rebuilt Browser and native Computer Use
boundary, a real Windows and macOS Buddy desktop overlay, centralized and
race-safe conversation cleanup, and live xAI image-generation capability
discovery. It makes visible automation faster and more truthful about what was
delivered or verified, lets Buddy operate the selected Chat, Developer, or
Designer thread without creating a second conversation, removes complete
thread-owned state without risking repositories or retained project artifacts,
and selects xAI image quality only from model-published combinations without
weakening local-first, approval, credential, screenshot, or typed-value
boundaries.

### Managed Browser And Shared Automation Contracts

- **Dedicated managed Browser service** - moves page ownership, observations,
  policy, history, runtime readiness, action dispatch, and recovery into
  `browser/`, leaving the Browser tool as a provider-neutral adapter rather
  than the owner of one large mutable runtime.
- **Opaque snapshot-bound targets** - retains exact ephemeral Playwright
  handles behind task, context, page, navigation, and snapshot tokens; stale,
  detached, drifted, cross-page, and cross-thread targets fail before an
  action can be dispatched.
- **Bounded semantic observations** - validates at most 1,000 interactive
  handles and 1 MiB before projecting at most 160 controls and 32 KiB, hides
  input values, records received and retained counts, and disposes handles when
  their snapshot expires.
- **Truthful thin receipts** - returns compact receipts for typing and
  non-navigating clicks, one observation for navigation, scrolling, and tab
  changes, and no automatic screenshot, Vision call, fixed sleep, or general
  `networkidle` wait after routine actions.
- **Approval-bound replay** - stages the exact Browser target at the point of
  risk, re-proves only that target after approval, completes the approved
  submit in the same tool invocation, and never lets an approval authorize a
  different element.
- **Exact managed Chromium runtime** - raises Python Playwright to the 1.62
  line, records its matching Chromium revision in an atomic manifest, installs
  only through an explicit Browser install or repair action, validates an
  offline page, and retains the prior known-good runtime for rollback.
- **No startup downloads** - Browser startup, MCP readiness, Designer export,
  conversation PDF export, and normal app launch perform read-only readiness
  checks and never install or repair Chromium implicitly.
- **Bounded launch fallback** - discovers installed Chrome or Edge without
  probe launches and, after one real selected-channel launch failure, falls
  back once only to an already-ready version-matched managed Chromium.
- **Thread-owned pages and recovery** - isolates tabs and popups by task,
  invalidates every owned observation after context or browser loss, performs
  one bounded restart without replaying an uncertain action, and cleans up
  idle or terminal task pages without disturbing active work.
- **Small shared automation vocabulary** - adds immutable observation,
  receipt, error, activity, and no-progress contracts shared by Browser and
  Computer Use while keeping their processes, leases, targets, histories, and
  persistence separate.

### Native Computer Use Reliability And Safety

- **Reviewed Cua Driver 0.20.0** - pins the signed upstream tag and commit,
  full Windows x86-64, Windows ARM64, and macOS universal archives, exact
  executable candidates, and SHA-256 values; Windows uses `mcp` while macOS
  preserves and launches the packaged app with `mcp --direct`.
- **Version-2 telemetry disclosure** - requires the expanded acknowledgement
  introduced after v4.8.0 before the upgraded driver can start. The reviewed
  telemetry is limited to pseudonymous identifiers and bounded product,
  platform, client, operation/outcome, duration/output, aggregate usage,
  permission, and lifecycle categories; tagged event builders exclude prompts,
  arguments/results, typed text, screenshots, accessibility trees, app/window
  names, URLs, paths, raw configuration values, and raw errors.
- **Function-first native actions** - keeps one flat provider-neutral schema
  for launch, capture, click, double-click, right-click, literal caret `type`,
  exact whole-value `replace_text`, key/hotkey, scroll, drag, menu invocation,
  state verification, and bounded wait behavior.
- **Direct semantic editing** - token-bound typing dispatches the issued
  current token after explicit disabled, read-only, secure, protected, and
  structural checks; combo boxes, grid/data cells, documents, and unknown
  interactive roles can reach the reviewed driver without hidden selection,
  clearing, clicking, or recapture steps.
- **One bounded foreground rung** - starts with background-safe delivery where
  supported and permits at most one same-action foreground attempt after an
  explicit driver refusal, with no separate focus action, effect replay, or
  silent switch to coordinates, Browser, shell, clipboard, or another engine.
- **Selected and document-aware projection** - keeps the fixed 80-element and
  12 KiB model envelope while preserving selected items and a bounded quota of
  document, grid, and actionable controls that would otherwise be crowded out
  by application chrome.
- **Exact semantic filtering** - can expose one omitted control by normalized
  label, role, and value prefix without coordinate guessing, refuses ambiguous
  matches, and keeps the full validated element set ephemeral and unavailable
  to stale model tokens.
- **Current application identity** - normalizes packaged and native app
  identities, prefers the unique active or visible matching window, preserves
  genuine ambiguity, and keeps platform identifiers such as AUMIDs out of
  model output, approvals, and logs.
- **Action-specific receipts** - separates dispatch, native delivery, visual
  change, and exact-value verification. An accepted but unverified action stays
  useful and does not create a pending-mutation latch, completion ledger,
  automatic replay, or final-answer override.
- **Bounded verification** - default click, type, key, scroll, and replacement
  actions make no hidden capture; optional replacement readback or visual
  checking uses at most one fresh capture and never treats a changed screen or
  free-form Vision prose as proof of the requested outcome.
- **Safer stale and no-progress recovery** - allows one same-target refresh and
  one same-action retry only when the structured receipt permits it, keeps
  candidate lists current, handles scroll and drag foreground delivery, and
  recommends Take over after the bounded route is exhausted.
- **Privacy-safe advisory scanning** - narrows prompt-injection detection to
  explicit role or hijacking signals, reports only bounded advisory categories,
  and does not turn ordinary UI text into an authorization decision or a hard
  action failure.
- **Permission and lifecycle recovery** - attributes macOS Accessibility and
  Screen Recording to the packaged Row-Bot host, preserves the Cua app bundle,
  links to the correct panes, and cleans up the private client and exclusive
  lease on Stop, thread deletion, disablement, uninstall, and app shutdown.
- **Tool-owned workflow guidance** - adds the twenty-third bundled tool guide
  for exact Browser-versus-Computer routing, current-generation targets,
  same-family recovery, foreground escalation, non-replayable mutations, and
  honest receipt interpretation.

### Buddy Desktop Overlay

- **Drag-to-undock companion** - replaces the old floating-window behavior
  with a native Windows and macOS overlay that tears off from the sidebar,
  stays on top, supports multi-monitor and negative-coordinate placement, and
  can be repositioned by its header.
- **One canonical placement model** - migrates legacy visibility and floating
  settings into docked or desktop placement plus visible and collapsed state,
  keeps old mirrors compatible, and returns Buddy to the dock on a new app
  launch without reviving a saved hidden preference.
- **Selected-thread messaging** - sends to the named Chat, Developer, or
  Designer conversation with its existing model, tools, approval mode, and
  surface context; sending with no selected thread creates one normal Chat
  conversation.
- **Draft and turn continuity** - shares each thread's saved draft with the
  full composer, captures the selected thread and surface when Send is pressed,
  never retargets an in-flight request after a UI selection change, and never
  adds implicit screenshots or attachments.
- **Live progress and scoped Stop** - projects current progress before tokens,
  the latest plain-text answer afterward, and sanitized errors without starting
  another turn; Stop cancels only the active generation for the selected
  thread.
- **Approval handoff** - resolves well-described simple approvals directly in
  the overlay, routes complex or incomplete approvals to the full thread, and
  synchronizes pending approval dialogs between Buddy and the main UI without
  permitting a stale or cross-thread decision.
- **Focus hand-back** - tracks only the last external foreground application,
  excludes Row-Bot windows, restores a minimized window once when needed, and
  makes one non-retrying activation attempt before the overlay sends.
- **Recoverable native lifecycle** - hides the main window instead of quitting
  while Buddy is torn off, exposes Open full thread, Collapse or Expand, Dock,
  and Hide actions, and adds tray recovery for both the overlay and the main
  window.
- **Compact visual polish** - uses an opaque fixed rectangular layout, three
  direct action buttons plus a menu, stable flex sizing, compact status bubbles,
  softened approval motion, state crossfades, and quieter idle-video replay.
- **Reliable terminal drag gesture** - prevents native snapshot interception,
  stale dock geometry, and window-local drag coordinates from turning one
  docked drag into duplicate, cancelled, or wrongly positioned gestures.

### Conversation Cleanup And Bulk Selection

- **Central deletion service** - replaces scattered thread deletion paths with
  one idempotent service for Chat, Designer, Developer, workflow, channel, and
  Agent-owned state, including metadata, checkpoints, writes, drafts, media,
  summaries, activation state, approvals, notifications, and cached UI state.
- **Race-safe producer cancellation** - marks a conversation as deleting,
  stops generation and active child Agents, blocks late checkpoint, event,
  media, draft, summary, and child-start writes, and keeps the guard until any
  in-flight producer has finalized.
- **Recursive Agent cleanup** - removes direct and nested child conversations,
  approvals, events, edges, locks, and runs while preventing a child-creation
  race from recreating state after its parent is gone.
- **Preserved workflow audits** - removes queued and thread-owned pipeline
  state while retaining workflow and run audit records with deleted thread,
  approval, message, and channel links scrubbed.
- **Designer ownership rules** - deleting a conversation detaches it while
  retaining the design; deleting the design removes its assets, history,
  published copy, cached session, and every linked conversation.
- **Developer recovery rules** - never deletes the real repository or selected
  folder, removes only safe clean managed worktrees, and retains dirty
  worktrees or sandboxes with unimported changes as explicit recovery
  workspaces.
- **Path-safe cleanup and repair** - rejects managed-path escapes and root
  deletion, removes only provable idle orphan artifacts and stale temporary
  files, and performs thresholded SQLite compaction when meaningful space can
  be reclaimed.
- **Accurate conversation library** - hides Agent child conversations, removes
  the obsolete Agents filter, assigns each user-managed conversation to one of
  Chat, Designer, Code, or Workflow, and reconciles visible counts from the
  same canonical dataset.
- **Filter-aware Select all** - selects or clears every item in the active
  filter without disturbing selections from another filter, keeps checkbox and
  destructive-target state synchronized, and includes collapsed Code rows
  while excluding hidden children.
- **Responsive bulk deletion** - paints a persistent progress dialog before
  offloading cleanup from the UI event loop, awaits asynchronous confirmation
  callbacks, always removes progress on failure, and reports retained recovery
  workspaces or partial failures.

### xAI Image Capability Discovery

- **Live image-model discovery** - queries xAI's `/image-generation-models`
  catalog alongside its general and language catalogs for both API-key and xAI
  OAuth providers, allowing newly advertised media models to enter the normal
  provider catalog without a model-name-only guess.
- **Generation-parameter metadata** - normalizes published quality and
  resolution options, defaults, and valid combinations into the shared model
  capability snapshot and preserves them through OAuth and catalog caches.
- **Capability-aware request planning** - sends xAI quality and resolution only
  when the selected model published a complete valid combination, chooses the
  highest supported tier for a High request, and otherwise uses provider
  defaults with a clear result note instead of inventing an unsupported pair.
- **Safer long-running media calls** - separates connect, pool, write,
  generation-read, and download-read timeouts, gives image generation up to ten
  minutes, refreshes OAuth once after a 401, and never retries an uncertain
  timed-out generation request.
- **Provider-contract coverage** - extends model serialization, capability
  resolution, media-model classification, API-key discovery, OAuth cache
  restoration, generation, editing, timeout, and download tests for the new
  metadata path.

### Cross-Surface Reliability, Documentation And Validation

- **Generation-wide Stop semantics** - wakes queued work, closes matching
  approvals, stops generation-linked child Agents, cancels Browser, Computer,
  shell, and Buddy activity for the selected generation, and prevents a stale
  approval callback from resuming work after Stop.
- **Approval synchronization** - lets the full UI display an approval raised
  from Buddy, hands modal ownership between connected local UI clients, and
  keeps unrelated thread or generation approvals isolated.
- **Managed export rendering** - uses the exact reviewed Chromium runtime for
  Unicode and Markdown-aware conversation PDFs plus Designer PDF, PNG, and PPTX
  rendering, with deterministic load completion instead of an unbounded
  network-idle wait.
- **PowerShell result accuracy** - treats an emitted PowerShell error record as
  failure even when a later statement succeeds, retains native nonzero exit
  codes, preserves successful warnings and persistent working directories, and
  releases shell locks after cancellation or detached launch.
- **Stable tool-guide prompting** - discovers guides from the effective active
  tool set, injects them into a stable prompt section for provider cache reuse,
  and preserves the compact custom-endpoint policy that omits all skills and
  guides at context windows of 32,768 tokens or less.
- **Safer compact tool traces** - groups Browser and Computer activity without
  exposing private JSON, renders structured failures truthfully, settles
  automatic skill loads into bounded plain labels, and keeps transcript export
  free of hidden activation metadata.
- **Protected documentation capture** - suppresses model-settings writes during
  authorized real-data screenshot capture, refreshes Buddy and Computer Use
  public guides and screenshots, and republishes generated reference and
  searchable site artifacts.
- **Changed-lane completeness** - makes the test matrix include committed
  branch changes, current working-tree edits, and untracked files so local and
  CI changed-source selection cannot silently omit new release work.
- **Deterministic architecture coverage** - adds shared automation contracts,
  managed Browser subsystem tests, extensive Computer Use action, privacy,
  targeting, focus, performance, and driver-verdict coverage, Buddy overlay
  and drag fixtures, thread cleanup and bulk-selection coverage, export and
  cancellation tests, and updated source-to-test ownership.

### Breaking Changes And Caveats

- No public CLI break or mandatory application-data migration is introduced by
  v4.9.0. Legacy Buddy settings migrate in place, and existing conversations,
  designs, repositories, workflows, and provider credentials remain local.
- Existing Computer Use installations from v4.8.0 use Cua Driver 0.7.1 and the
  version-1 disclosure. They must install or repair the reviewed 0.20.0 full
  archive and accept the expanded version-2 disclosure before Computer Use can
  start; no driver download occurs during ordinary startup or readiness checks.
- Browser Automation now requires the Chromium revision matching the installed
  Playwright 1.62.x package. A mismatched or missing managed runtime fails
  closed and must be installed or repaired explicitly; an already installed
  supported Chrome or Edge channel can still be selected.
- Conversation and design deletion remain irreversible and approval-gated.
  Dirty Developer worktrees, real repositories, selected source folders, and
  sandboxes with unimported changes are retained rather than deleted; workflow
  audit rows remain with sensitive live links removed.
- The Buddy desktop overlay requires the native Windows or macOS app. Linux,
  server/browser mode, compact mobile presentation, and remote browsers keep
  Buddy docked inside Row-Bot.
- Computer Use remains beta, local-interactive-only, off by default, and
  unavailable to schedules, channels, background workflows, child Agents,
  plugins, external MCP callers, mobile clients, and headless/server sessions.
  Browser and Computer remain separate engines and never silently substitute
  for one another after a structured refusal.

## v4.8.0 - Reasoning Controls, Context Safety & Native OpenCode Discovery

This release builds on v4.7.1 with provider-aware reasoning controls, safer
context-capacity handling, more resilient rolling compaction, native OpenCode
gateway discovery, and a responsive desktop composer. It lets each chat keep
an exact model-specific reasoning choice, prevents custom endpoints from
silently inheriting an invented context window, recovers more long
conversations without a compaction failure loop, discovers newly listed
OpenCode models with their real transport metadata, and strengthens Google,
Anthropic-routed, mobile, and streaming compatibility without weakening
local-first, approval, credential, or transcript boundaries.

### Provider-Aware Reasoning Controls

- **Exact model controls** - adds Provider default, supported effort levels,
  thinking On or Off, and bounded token-budget choices only when the active
  provider-qualified model exposes an actionable capability.
- **Thread-and-model persistence** - stores reasoning selections locally for
  one thread and one canonical model reference, restores a valid selection
  when that model is revisited, and does not leak it into another chat or an
  incompatible model.
- **Desktop and mobile access** - adds a Thinking picker beside the desktop
  model control, exposes the same choices inside mobile Chat controls, and
  shares the behavior with normal Chat, Designer Studio, and Developer Studio.
- **Slash and channel control** - adds `/reasoning` to Chat and Telegram,
  Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, and SMS conversations; the bare desktop or mobile
  command opens the visible control while explicit effort, toggle, budget, and
  default arguments are validated against the active model.
- **Provider-native requests** - maps supported selections to OpenAI and Codex,
  Anthropic and Claude Subscription, Google, xAI, Ollama and Ollama Cloud,
  OpenRouter, OpenCode, and compatible-endpoint request formats without
  applying a provider-wide guess to an unknown model.
- **Custom endpoint controls** - extends Custom/Self-hosted provider settings
  with reasoning Auto, On, or Off behavior, optional thinking budgets,
  returned-reasoning preservation, explicit replay capability, and advanced
  request JSON for endpoints that require compatibility tuning.
- **Separate thinking presentation** - streams returned reasoning separately
  from the final answer and retains it as a collapsed Thinking section when
  the provider returns replayable content.
- **One safe compatibility fallback** - when a provider rejects a valid-looking
  explicit reasoning option before producing output, retries once with
  Provider default, clears only that rejected model selection, and shows a
  local notice; authentication, rate-limit, timeout, cancellation, server, and
  mid-stream failures are not silently replayed.
- **Single stream callback path** - isolates callbacks inside the reasoning
  fallback wrapper so normal and fallback streaming cannot duplicate visible
  tokens, tool events, or completion callbacks.

### Context Capacity And Compaction Recovery

- **Custom endpoint capacity ownership** - treats every Custom/Self-hosted
  endpoint as server-managed even when it runs locally, uses only detected or
  manually declared model capacity in Auto, and no longer presents the generic
  remote 128K application fallback as evidence about a custom server.
- **Fail-closed unknown custom context** - keeps a custom model unavailable
  when Row-Bot cannot determine its context window and no cap is set, with
  guidance to refresh or probe the endpoint, declare its native limit, choose
  a verified Custom cap, or select another model.
- **Exact advanced context values** - adds validated Custom context entries
  from 16,384 through 4,194,304 tokens for local and provider models while
  retaining the common 16K through 1M presets and preserving exact saved
  values across the context-policy v3 migration.
- **64K local Auto target** - raises the recommended Ollama Auto request from
  32K to 65,536 tokens, still capped by known native metadata or the observed
  loaded allocation; a fixed 32K choice remains available for smaller-memory
  or reduced-tool configurations.
- **Server-safe request behavior** - treats the app setting as a planning cap,
  not permission to reconfigure the server, and stops sending the undocumented
  `n_ctx` chat-completions field to llama.cpp; server context remains a startup
  setting such as `--ctx-size`.
- **Model-scoped endpoint probes** - records which model a Custom endpoint
  probe tested and applies chat, tool-round-trip, streaming, and context
  evidence only to that model, preventing a successful sibling model from
  promoting or changing transport behavior for an untested one.
- **Readiness aligned with evidence** - promotes a probed custom model to Agent
  mode only after a successful tool round trip, keeps verified chat-only models
  in Chat Only, blocks failed chat probes, and preserves the minimum context
  floor even after a successful tool probe.
- **Fixed-envelope preflight** - measures the non-compactable system prompt and
  bound tool schemas before attempting rolling compaction and produces an exact
  estimated-versus-usable token error when the selected context cannot fit
  them.
- **Newest-turn recovery** - when retaining two recent groups cannot create
  enough slack, safely ages one more complete atomic group while keeping the
  newest group intact, including tool-call and tool-result pairs.
- **Exact rebuild fallback** - validates the rebuilt prompt before persistence,
  makes one additional bounded summary pass when necessary, and saves only the
  final successful summary state so an oversized intermediate result cannot
  trap the unchanged conversation in a repeated failure loop.
- **Private failure diagnostics** - logs bounded known compaction reasons while
  reducing unexpected exceptions to their class name, keeping transcript and
  provider text out of warning logs.

### Native OpenCode Gateway Discovery

- **Live gateway intersection** - refreshes the OpenCode Zen and OpenCode Go
  `/models` catalogs and intersects each gateway's actual availability with
  the public native routing metadata used by OpenCode.
- **Per-model transport routing** - derives OpenAI Chat, OpenAI Responses,
  Anthropic Messages, or Google GenAI transport from explicit model or provider
  SDK metadata instead of relying only on a maintained model-name classifier.
- **Richer model metadata** - persists provider-qualified display names,
  context windows, input and output modalities, tool calling, streaming, and
  reasoning capability so newly listed supported models can flow through the
  catalog, readiness checks, context policy, and runtime after refresh.
- **Google gateway support** - enables OpenCode models routed through Google
  GenAI with the gateway's v1 endpoint and provider-native reasoning request
  mapping.
- **Durable dynamic routes** - restores cached OpenCode route metadata after a
  restart, retains the legacy static classifier for older cache rows, and fails
  closed with a sanitized diagnostic when a cached or newly advertised native
  protocol is unsupported.
- **Failure-safe refreshes** - coalesces the shared native-registry request
  across a full provider refresh, preserves the last known good gateway rows on
  network or registry failure, uses the static catalog only for a cold failed
  refresh, clears stale rows after a valid empty gateway response, and keeps
  Zen and Go caches isolated.

### Composer And Provider Compatibility

- **Responsive desktop composer** - uses component-width breakpoints to compact
  Model, Thinking, and Approval labels progressively while keeping each icon,
  picker, tooltip, keyboard target, and accessible state available.
- **Compact secondary controls** - collapses active Skill chips into a counted
  Skills button, shortens the context meter without losing its threshold or
  tooltip, moves transient voice status above the toolbar, and gives Send and
  Stop one stable action slot so controls do not wrap or jump.
- **Clearer desktop invitation** - updates desktop Chat, Designer, and Developer
  composer copy to “Do anything…” while retaining the compact mobile wording.
- **Google adapter modernization** - moves to the consolidated
  `langchain-google-genai` 4.x adapter and `langchain-core` 1.6 line, removes
  the retired `google-ai-generativelanguage` runtime dependency, and updates
  effective tool-schema inspection for the new SDK declarations.
- **Google feature preservation** - verifies typed array and union tool schemas,
  streaming, multimodal input, thought-signature replay, reasoning defaults,
  and asynchronous cancellation through the consolidated adapter.
- **Routed Claude history repair** - recognizes Claude routes through OpenRouter
  and Requesty, consolidates late system messages for Anthropic Messages, keeps
  tool-call/result groups valid, and leaves the durable checkpoint transcript
  unchanged.
- **Google history repair** - normalizes replayable Google reasoning or thinking
  blocks and drops private incompatible blocks only in the provider-facing copy
  so switching from another transport cannot fail before the Google request.
- **Awaited mobile submission** - keeps mobile send handling inside the UI
  callback lifecycle instead of spawning an untracked task, improving error
  propagation and deterministic command behavior.

### Documentation, Dependencies And Release Validation

- **Reasoning user guide** - adds a dedicated public Reasoning Controls page,
  navigation, provider/settings links, `/reasoning` examples, persistence and
  fallback behavior, privacy guidance, and troubleshooting, then regenerates
  the searchable documentation artifacts.
- **Context documentation sync** - updates generated settings references and
  published pages for the 64K local Auto target, exact custom values, custom
  server capacity semantics, and model-scoped endpoint evidence.
- **Post-4.7.1 site completion** - aligns the already published landing-page
  downloads and contracts with v4.7.1 before the v4.8 documentation work.
- **Provider and agent coverage** - adds deterministic coverage for reasoning
  capability resolution, persistence, commands, transport payloads, fallback
  classification, duplicate callback prevention, custom endpoint context and
  probe isolation, fixed-envelope failures, compaction fallback, and dynamic
  OpenCode refresh-to-runtime behavior.
- **UI and compatibility coverage** - adds responsive desktop composer,
  accessible compact-control, context-meter, mobile reasoning, Google adapter,
  routed-Claude normalization, tool-schema, Gmail, Goal, Requesty, and
  cancellation contracts, and updates source-to-test ownership for the new
  provider modules.

### Breaking Changes And Caveats

- No application data migration or public CLI break is introduced by v4.8.0;
  model and thread settings migrate in place.
- Existing local Auto context settings now target 64K instead of 32K and can
  therefore use more Ollama memory. Select a fixed 32K context if the larger
  allocation is unsuitable for the machine or model.
- A Custom/Self-hosted model with unknown native context no longer inherits a
  generic fallback. Refresh or probe it, declare the server's native limit, or
  set a verified Custom cap before use.
- A Custom server context cap limits Row-Bot's planning and requests; it does
  not change the server's loaded allocation. Configure llama.cpp, vLLM,
  SGLang, LM Studio, or another server independently.
- Reasoning options, latency, token use, and billing are model- and
  provider-specific. Provider default remains the compatibility choice, and
  reasoning replay for a custom endpoint should be enabled only when that
  endpoint's format and trust boundary are understood.
- OpenCode catalog refresh now consults both the selected gateway and the
  public native routing registry. A failed refresh preserves the last known
  good rows or uses the bundled static fallback on a cold cache.

## v4.7.1 - Agent Recovery, Local Voice Options & Runtime Reliability

This patch release builds on v4.7.0 with focused agent-orchestration,
local-voice, channel-startup, model-readiness, memory-cache, and release-
validation fixes. It lets parallel child Agents work in explicitly assigned
local folders, restores interrupted parents safely after detached shell work,
adds an explicit offline SenseVoice transcription option, makes Telegram and
remote-access startup degrade cleanly, trusts Ollama's native tool-capability
metadata, and hardens Docker smoke diagnostics without weakening local-first,
approval, or credential boundaries.

### Agent Workspaces, Shell Completion And Restart Recovery

- **Folder-scoped child workspaces** - adds `developer_workspace_path` to
  `delegate_work`, registers an existing local folder as the child's Developer
  workspace, rejects missing paths and conflicting workspace-id/path inputs,
  and keeps the assignment scoped to that child run.
- **Independent parallel writers** - keys write ownership to each assigned
  Developer workspace so child Agents in distinct folders can edit
  concurrently while children assigned to the same folder still serialize.
- **Durable first-delegation state** - records the original parent's safe
  configurable runtime fields, enabled tools, model, approval mode, and
  delivery context when asynchronous orchestration begins, excluding
  non-serializable internal graph callbacks.
- **Checkpoint-safe parent repair** - closes only unanswered tool calls after
  an app restart, marks them as interrupted rather than replaying them, and
  resumes the original parent from its saved checkpoint when retained required
  child results are ready.
- **Legacy recovery compatibility** - can wake and complete an interrupted v2
  parent whose children already finished even when older orchestration rows do
  not contain the newly persisted continuation snapshot.
- **Detached-process completion** - captures owned subprocess output in
  temporary files so a deliberately detached descendant cannot keep inherited
  stdout or stderr pipes open and indefinitely block its parent Agent or shell
  workspace lock.
- **Bounded cancellation and timeout drain** - preserves partial output and
  cancellation status, terminates the owned process tree, and avoids a second
  unbounded `communicate()` wait after timeout.

### Optional Local SenseVoice Transcription

- **FunASR / SenseVoice choice** - adds SenseVoice Small as a selectable local
  speech-to-text model for Talk and Dictation alongside faster-whisper, with
  the selected local model applied consistently when either voice mode starts.
- **Explicit installation only** - keeps readiness checks, startup, and normal
  transcription cache-only; the approximately 940 MB ModelScope snapshot is
  downloaded only from the Voice settings action.
- **Verified offline snapshot** - accepts only a complete model inside
  Row-Bot's SenseVoice cache, persists the verified path across restarts, runs
  CPU inference against that local path, and disables FunASR update checks.
- **Recoverable status and setup** - distinguishes unsupported platforms,
  missing packages, missing model data, and invalid snapshots; exposes clear
  install or reinstall guidance without making the model appear ready early.
- **Transparent network boundary** - discloses the ModelScope download, model
  size, license, and SDK user-agent before installation; no audio, prompts, or
  usage data are sent, and regular transcription remains offline.
- **Platform guard** - keeps SenseVoice unavailable on Intel macOS, where the
  matching CPU PyTorch and Torchaudio wheels are not published, while leaving
  local Whisper available.

### Telegram, Tunnel And Startup Resilience

- **Retryable Telegram initialization** - retries one transient Telegram
  network failure and gives polling one bootstrap retry without looping on an
  invalid token.
- **Clean failed-start recovery** - shuts down every partially initialized
  Telegram component best-effort, clears global lifecycle state, surfaces a
  safe actionable invalid-token error, and permits a fresh start afterwards.
- **Non-blocking command registration** - starts polling before registering
  the BotFather command menu so a registration failure cannot take a working
  bot offline.
- **Responsive tunnel auto-start** - shows an explicit startup stage and moves
  main-app tunnel creation off the UI event loop so slow tunnel setup does not
  freeze the startup experience.
- **Reliable splash completion** - treats the `/readyz` HTTP success status as
  the readiness contract instead of requiring a JSON body that the public
  readiness boundary does not promise.
- **Credential-safe channel diagnostics** - records only the channel name and
  exception type for manual start failures while preserving the existing
  user-facing error notification.

### Ollama Readiness And Docker Release Validation

- **Native Ollama capabilities** - consumes the daemon-reported
  `capabilities` list when available, allowing new or unknown model families
  that advertise `tools` to enter Agent mode without an unnecessary live
  round-trip probe.
- **Authoritative negative detection** - does not mark a familiar family as
  tool-capable when Ollama explicitly omits `tools`; an explicit boolean
  capability remains highest priority and the maintained family table remains
  the fallback only when native metadata is absent.
- **Stable container readiness** - requires two consecutive successful
  `/healthz` and `/readyz` samples and gives every functional Docker smoke
  request a configurable timeout.
- **Safe transient HTTP retry** - retries short-lived transport failures only
  for idempotent GET checks after restarts or recreation and never replays
  invitation claims, refreshes, or other POST operations.
- **Actionable secret-safe failures** - reports the failed stage, HTTP method,
  path, and exception type, then emits bounded container state and log-tail
  diagnostics with exact smoke-owned invitation, session, and encryption
  values redacted.

### Memory, Dependencies And Public Documentation

- **Consistent embedding snapshots** - applies the same GGUF, ONNX, and
  OpenVINO ignore filters during cache-only local-embedding lookup as during
  explicit download, preventing a valid cached snapshot from being
  misidentified or resolved differently.
- **Voice runtime dependency verification** - adds FunASR, ModelScope,
  matching CPU PyTorch/Torchaudio packages, lockfile coverage, installer export
  coverage, and platform-aware import verification to the voice and all extras.
- **Security dependency cleanup** - updates the Python, documentation-site,
  and WhatsApp bridge resolutions, upgrades the supported arXiv,
  Hugging Face/Transformers, and pytest lines, pins vulnerable documentation
  transitive packages where compatible, and narrows OSV exceptions to the
  remaining reviewed packages without compatible fixes.
- **4.7 public-site alignment** - updates the post-tag landing, Features, and
  Architecture pages and their contracts to the v4.7.0 downloads, metadata,
  cache revisions, progressive capability loading, context management, and
  trusted-address descriptions.
- **README voice disclosure** - documents the SenseVoice option, explicit
  ModelScope download, offline inference boundary, Intel macOS limitation, and
  FunASR acknowledgement.
- **4.7.1 release documentation** - updates the full README and architecture
  reference, public Voice, Remote Access, Agents, Developer, Channels, Ollama,
  and Docker guides, generated reference/search artifacts, installer build
  notes, marketing support pages, and release-version metadata while leaving
  the separately staged landing `index.html` unchanged.

### Tests And Release Validation

- **Agent recovery coverage** - verifies folder registration, invalid workspace
  inputs, independent writer locks, first-delegation snapshots, orphan-only
  checkpoint repair, terminal-child parent wakeup, detached descendants,
  bounded timeout cleanup, cancellation output, and shell lock release.
- **Voice coverage** - verifies no-download startup and transcription,
  explicit snapshot installation, persisted and contained model paths,
  incomplete-cache recovery, package/platform status, catalog readiness,
  Talk/Dictation selection, dependency metadata, and settings disclosures.
- **Telegram lifecycle coverage** - verifies one-retry success, exhausted
  network cleanup, invalid-token handling, non-fatal command registration, and
  a clean restart after partial initialization failure.
- **Provider and Docker coverage** - verifies Ollama native positive, negative,
  and explicit-override precedence plus Docker readiness stability, GET-only
  retries, POST no-replay, functional request deadlines, bounded diagnostics,
  and credential redaction.
- **Documentation contracts** - verifies the staged v4.7.1 support-page
  downloads and metadata alongside the unchanged v4.7.0 landing page,
  evergreen feature inventory, generated references, architecture copy,
  internal links, responsive fallbacks, and analytics boundaries.

### Breaking Changes And Caveats

- No application data migration or public CLI break is introduced by v4.7.1.
- SenseVoice requires an explicit approximately 940 MB ModelScope download and
  is not supported on Intel macOS. Local Whisper remains the default and the
  fallback local transcription path.
- Separate `developer_workspace_path` folders permit independent child writer
  locks; changing only a shell working directory does not. Existing folders
  are registered, never created implicitly, and the same folder still permits
  only one child writer at a time.
- A detached command is considered complete when the directly launched process
  exits. Row-Bot does not adopt or later cancel an intentionally detached
  descendant that has left the owned process group.
- Docker smoke transport retries remain deliberately limited to GET requests;
  non-idempotent access and session operations fail without replay.
- The remaining temporary OSV exceptions cover only reviewed dependency
  versions without a compatible fixed line and expire on September 30, 2026.

## v4.7.0 - Progressive Capabilities, Context Management & Trusted Access

This release builds on v4.6.0 with a prompt-efficiency, long-conversation,
remote-access, and runtime-reliability pass. It discovers enabled external
tools and task-specific skills only when they are relevant, meters the complete
next model input and safely compacts older context, lets owners manage exact
trusted browser addresses without weakening managed deployment policy, and
hardens provider catalogs, OpenAI-compatible streams, chat traces, public
documentation, and deterministic validation around those changes.

### Progressive Tool And Skill Discovery

- **Auto capability loading** - keeps core tools allowed by the active Agent
  Profile directly available while enabled MCP, plugin, Custom Tool, and
  channel capabilities remain searchable until a request needs them.
- **Deterministic local search** - ranks authorized capability metadata across
  names, aliases, sources, descriptions, tags, and parameter names without a
  provider call, caps returned matches, and keeps stable ordering.
- **Exact external invocation** - returns the effective target schema, validates
  arguments again before dispatch, preserves the real integration identity in
  live and reopened traces, and never turns search into authorization.
- **Unchanged safety boundaries** - preserves profile filtering, tool
  enablement, provider compatibility, approvals, prompt-injection handling,
  execution budgets, cancellation, and workspace policy for discovered tools.
- **Bounded capability manifests** - sanitizes untrusted catalog metadata,
  omits instruction-like descriptions, rejects core, bridge, and ambiguous
  external name collisions, and degrades oversized manifests without flooding
  the model context.
- **Progressive skill loading** - searches enabled manual and plugin skills,
  activates the selected instructions for the current task, safely confines
  optional UTF-8 references to the skill root, and displays one compact
  **Using _skill_** receipt plus an active-skill chip.
- **Durable task scope** - restores automatically selected skills when a task is
  reopened, retains at most five automatic selections per task, treats a repeat
  load as a no-op, and keeps pinned skills under their existing manual control.
- **Parent and child isolation** - gives every child Agent its own skill state,
  profile, tool allow-list, approval mode, workspace, and execution budget;
  skill instructions cannot grant a denied tool or enable delegation.
- **Tools settings and compatibility** - adds **Settings → Tools → Capability
  loading**, makes **Auto-select external tools** the recommended mode, keeps
  **Load all external tools** for eager compatibility, and moves the former
  Search settings surface into Tools.

### Context Window Meter And Rolling Compaction

- The desktop composer now shows an event-driven estimate of the complete next
  model input, including system prompts, images, and bound tool schemas. Mobile
  keeps the narrower composer and shows only durable compaction status rows.
- Agent Mode, tool-loop calls, resumes, and Chat Only share token accounting and
  bounded rolling compaction. Older history is summarized as untrusted reference
  data while recent complete turns and tool-call/result groups remain intact.
- Context settings migrate to policy version 2. The historical local 32K value
  becomes Auto (still requesting 32K, capped by native/observed Ollama capacity),
  and the historical provider 128K value becomes Auto. Because an old explicit
  128K selection cannot be distinguished from the former default, restore it via
  **Settings → Models → Advanced context → Provider context override** if needed.
- Successful compaction produces one durable presentation-only timeline notice
  and, for channel-originated turns, one separately claimed channel notice.
  Context events never enter model prompts, summaries, or token accounting.
- **Capacity-aware policy** - resolves provider metadata, maintained limits,
  local requested and observed Ollama allocations, and custom-endpoint
  overrides; an unknown remote model uses a disclosed 128K application fallback
  for metering and compaction authority rather than claiming provider metadata.
- **Safe headroom** - reserves input space according to combined-window versus
  input-only provider semantics and begins compaction at 75 percent of the
  effective context limit.
- **Recent-turn integrity** - compacts complete older user-led groups while
  retaining at least two recent complete turns and intact tool-call/result
  groups, and marks the rolling summary as untrusted historical reference data
  subordinate to the newest raw user instruction.
- **Durable concurrency and recovery** - validates checkpoint revisions and
  boundary digests, saves summaries with compare-and-swap, accepts a valid
  concurrent winner, bounds compactor input and output, honors stop requests,
  and fails safely when sufficient context slack cannot be created.
- **Overflow diagnostics** - remembers when a model exceeds its reported
  capacity during the session and asks for a different model or reviewed
  context override instead of repeatedly sending the same oversized input.

### Trusted Remote Addresses And Invitations

- **Durable trusted addresses** - lets an authenticated owner add one exact
  HTTP or HTTPS origin in Remote Access settings, saves it in
  `access_routes.json`, applies Host/origin admission immediately, and creates
  an origin-bound invitation without a restart.
- **Visible lifecycle controls** - lists saved addresses after restart, includes
  them in the invitation route selector, and removes one only after confirmation;
  new HTTP and WebSocket traffic through a removed address is rejected at once.
- **Strict origin validation** - accepts an exact scheme, host, and optional
  port while rejecting credentials, paths, queries, fragments, wildcards,
  malformed ports, and non-HTTP(S) schemes.
- **Managed deployment ownership** - shows `ROW_BOT_PUBLIC_ORIGINS` entries as
  externally managed and makes add/remove controls read-only when
  `ROW_BOT_ALLOWED_HOSTS` owns Host admission, so UI state cannot override
  explicit operator policy.
- **No implied network provisioning** - makes clear that trusting an address
  does not perform DNS or reachability checks, provision TLS, configure a proxy
  or firewall, or change Row-Bot's listen address; HTTP remains unencrypted.
- **Restored custom routes** - repairs invitation creation for exact
  operator-configured browser-facing origins and revalidates the route inventory
  at creation time so stale or unavailable selections are refused.
- **Assigned-interface discovery** - offers usable unicast addresses actually
  assigned to the computer even when they are outside RFC-private ranges, while
  excluding loopback, link-local, unspecified, and multicast addresses.
- **Exposure-specific guidance** - gives non-private interface addresses a
  stronger warning about possible external routing, firewalls, plaintext HTTP,
  and the safer HTTPS or Tailscale alternatives.

### Provider, Streaming And Chat Reliability

- **Provider-scoped catalog credentials** - refreshes OpenAI, Ollama Cloud,
  OpenRouter, Requesty, Anthropic, Google, xAI, MiniMax, OpenCode, and Atlas
  Cloud catalogs through the provider auth store, so a key saved only in
  Settings immediately populates provider-qualified model rows without a
  legacy environment-key mirror.
- **Long-response timeout policy** - gives OpenAI-compatible requests separate
  10-second connect/pool, 120-second write, and 900-second read-inactivity
  limits. `ROW_BOT_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_READ_TIMEOUT` accepts a positive seconds
  override and falls back safely when invalid.
- **Safe pre-stream retry** - retries a timeout or remote-protocol failure once
  only when no stream event has been emitted, never replays partial output, and
  checks cancellation before retrying.
- **Quieter tool traces** - makes collapsed live and reopened tool rows smaller,
  lighter, and less visually dominant while preserving full result content and
  success/failure state inside their expansions.

### Public Website And Documentation

- **Stable release alignment** - finishes the public 4.6.0 metadata, downloads,
  Linux command, cache revisions, structured data, fallbacks, and cross-page
  navigation that landed immediately after the 4.6.0 source tag.
- **Workbench-first explanations** - updates the public docs and landing copy
  around parent-led agents, durable documents, authenticated remote access,
  Docker/VPS operation, compact presentation, and the complete models, tools,
  memory, workflows, code, design, messaging, and voice surface.
- **Clearer public imagery** - leads the documentation with the Knowledge
  workspace, revision-tags screenshot assets, handles query strings in local
  image validation, and keeps architecture diagrams full width.
- **Public-site conversion contracts** - centralizes the marketing-page Google
  tag bootstrap and measures desktop download, Linux install-view, and
  installation-guide actions; this is public-website behavior, not Row-Bot
  application telemetry.
- **Progressive capability guide** - documents Auto and eager modes, tool and
  skill discovery, chat receipts, parent/child boundaries, troubleshooting,
  and the related Tools, Skills, extension, mobile, and request-lifecycle pages.
- **Remote-access guide** - documents trusted-address persistence and removal,
  exact-origin rules, assigned-interface warnings, externally managed settings,
  and the DNS, TLS, proxy, firewall, and reachability responsibilities Row-Bot
  deliberately does not assume.

### Tests And Release Validation

- **Capability-discovery coverage** - verifies ranking, collisions, manifests,
  schema validation, approvals, cancellation, execution budgets, child
  boundaries, persistence, transcripts, status, plugins, MCP, channels, mobile,
  and public documentation.
- **Context-management coverage** - verifies policy migration and resolution,
  complete-input accounting, compaction boundaries, summary validation,
  persistence, concurrency, failures, Agent and Chat Only parity, channels,
  SMS, mobile, and the desktop meter.
- **Remote-access coverage** - verifies route inventory, non-private interface
  classification, invitation revalidation, trusted-address mutation, runtime
  HTTP/WebSocket admission, managed-policy precedence, UI controls, and docs.
- **Provider and chat regressions** - verifies timeout phases, retry/no-replay,
  cancellation, provider-only credentials, catalog caching and qualification,
  first-class providers, Settings dialogs, and live/reopened trace styling.
- **Public-site contracts** - verifies fallbacks, internal links, versioned
  images, responsive calls to action, architecture lightboxes, generated pages,
  tag initialization, and download/install event payloads.

### Breaking Changes And Caveats

- Auto-select is the recommended external capability mode. Use **Settings →
  Tools → Capability loading → Load all external tools** when an older provider
  or integration requires every enabled external schema to be bound eagerly.
- Context policy version 2 interprets the historical local 32K and provider
  128K values as Auto because old settings did not distinguish defaults from
  explicit choices. Restore a deliberate provider 128K cap in Advanced context
  settings if required.
- Rolling compaction uses the selected model/provider to summarize older
  history. It does not create a new provider route, but cloud-selected tasks
  send the bounded aged range to that cloud provider as part of normal model
  use.
- Every trusted remote address admits the same single Row-Bot owner after
  invitation authentication. Add exact origins only when you control the route,
  and remove them when they are no longer needed.
- Direct HTTP remains unencrypted, and a non-private assigned interface may be
  externally routable. Prefer private Tailscale HTTPS or an operator-managed
  HTTPS reverse proxy outside a trusted LAN.
- Trusting an HTTPS origin does not create DNS, certificates, proxy trust,
  firewall rules, or a listener. Those remain explicit operator responsibilities.
- The public marketing pages load Google tag services and record the listed
  install/download interactions. The Row-Bot application itself adds no
  first-party telemetry or hidden phone-home behavior.
- The default OpenAI-compatible read-inactivity limit is now 900 seconds. Set a
  reviewed positive `ROW_BOT_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_READ_TIMEOUT` value if an
  endpoint needs a different ceiling.

## v4.6.0 - Agent Orchestration, Remote Access & Docker Operations

This release builds on v4.5.0 with a durable-agent, document-processing,
multi-device, and server-operations pass. It turns delegated agents into one
recoverable parent-led orchestration, replaces synchronous document loading
with a bounded resumable queue and sharded index, gives one owner authenticated
access from desktop and remote browsers, ships an official hardened Docker/VPS
path, and aligns the chat, mobile, website, documentation, and release
validation surfaces around those capabilities.

### Automatic Agent Orchestration

- **One authoritative parent turn** - keeps the original agent responsible for
  planning, delegated work, follow-up waves, and the final response instead of
  turning child completions into disconnected summaries.
- **Required and background work** - distinguishes child results the parent
  must join from optional detached tasks that remain durable without blocking
  the foreground answer.
- **Dependencies and work waves** - supports ordered child dependencies,
  several rounds of delegation in one parent turn, duplicate-objective checks,
  and the existing per-parent and application-wide capacity limits.
- **Live child joins** - routes child completions, transient retries, approval
  requests, user steering, and stop events through an ordered durable inbox so
  the parent can react without polling or starting a replacement conversation.
- **Checkpoint-safe suspension** - records parent checkpoint identity, pending
  events, approvals, output metadata, and execution budget before a long-running
  parent releases its foreground stream.
- **Exactly-once completion** - uses durable leases and finalization claims to
  prevent duplicate parent runners, acknowledgements, synthesis, channel sends,
  or final chat answers when callbacks race.
- **Recovery and explicit resume** - repairs interrupted work after restart,
  restores already-recorded child terminal events, and revalidates the selected
  agents, model, workspaces, and Designer project before resuming.
- **Controlled retries and stops** - retries one classified transient child
  failure without breaking dependency barriers and supports individual or
  group stop while allowing the parent to close naturally.
- **Bounded context and execution** - orders and caps result packets, preserves
  worktree references, reuses the parent budget across event turns, and retains
  repeated-action termination and exactly-once budget finalization.

### Chat, Goals, Channels & Agent Activity

- **Compact inline Agent cards** - replaces bulky child-run output with compact
  live cards that show queued, running, approval, retry, stopped, failed, and
  completed states inside the conversation.
- **Parent Agent groups** - presents related child work as one durable group,
  streams lifecycle rows as children change, and keeps later delegation waves
  attached to the same parent generation.
- **Shared activity truth** - drives desktop, sidebar, mobile, Agent drawer,
  Buddy, and voice indicators from the same durable orchestration query rather
  than independent timers or optimistic UI state.
- **Transcript-safe restoration** - persists Agent metadata and ordering through
  checkpoints, reloads visible cards without duplicate completion rows, and
  places late child updates before future queued user turns.
- **Approval continuity** - surfaces child approvals in the parent transcript,
  deduplicates repeated approval notices, and resumes the original checkpoint
  after a decision.
- **Goal and workflow continuation** - lets Goal Mode continue after a completed
  orchestration and updates delegated Workflow steps to use the same durable
  parent/child lifecycle.
- **Channel-safe delivery** - carries orchestration acknowledgement, activity,
  approval, completion, and retry semantics through supported channel runtimes
  without sending preview drafts or duplicate final messages.
- **Cross-studio hardening** - protects concurrent Designer projects,
  Developer workspaces, filesystem confirmation, queued messages, tool traces,
  and stop handling while child agents are active.

### Durable Bounded Document Ingestion

- **Persistent batch queue** - replaces synchronous all-in-memory ingestion with
  SQLite-backed batches and jobs that survive restart and expose clear queued,
  indexing, searchable, extracting, completed, failed, cancelled, and duplicate
  states.
- **Bounded safe uploads** - streams files to staging while hashing, caps each
  file at 256 MiB, preserves a 2 GiB disk reserve, contains filenames, isolates
  interrupted cleanup, and allows same-name files when their contents differ.
- **Content deduplication** - skips duplicate bytes across existing documents or
  the same selected batch while retaining stable document IDs and source
  records.
- **Fair single-flight work** - uses a durable FIFO queue, leases, heartbeats,
  and one supervisor, and makes every document in a batch searchable before
  starting the slower extraction phase.
- **Pause, cancel, retry, and repair** - persists queue controls, resumes safe
  extraction checkpoints, restarts incomplete indexing, fails missing sources
  explicitly, and retires orphaned staging or work data.
- **Sharded atomic vectors** - builds embeddings in batches of at most 32 chunks,
  rolls index segments at 2,000 chunks, and publishes a new document manifest
  atomically so failed replacements leave the old searchable corpus intact.
- **Deterministic mixed search** - merges compatible new shards and legacy
  vectors into stable top-k results, excludes stale embedding configurations,
  and supports ID-specific removal, cache release, and bounded rebuilds.
- **Resumable knowledge extraction** - persists rolling map windows and
  hierarchical reductions in groups of at most eight, checks cancellation
  between provider calls, isolates failures by document, and commits document,
  graph, and Wiki Vault results idempotently.
- **Visible queue operations** - adds batch and job progress, pause/resume,
  cancel, retry, clear-finished, indexed-document management, status-bar
  activity, and queue/index health diagnostics to the Documents surface.

### Single-Owner Multi-Device Access

- **One owner, multiple presentations** - treats authenticated desktop, remote
  desktop, and compact/mobile sessions as the same Row-Bot owner; compact mode
  changes layout, not permissions.
- **Authenticated server mode** - adds `row-bot serve` for long-running headless
  operation and keeps server-mode loopback behind authentication instead of
  inheriting the desktop application's implicit local-owner trust.
- **Access management CLI** - adds `row-bot access invite`, listing, revocation,
  and redacted doctor commands without importing the UI runtime or printing a
  stored invitation secret more than once.
- **One-time invitations** - creates origin-bound, expiring invitation links,
  stores only hashes, permits exactly one concurrent claim, and returns terminal
  recovery pages for expired, cancelled, locked, or already-used links.
- **Durable revocable sessions** - adds instance-isolated HttpOnly cookies,
  authoritative server expiry, active renewal, logout, per-session revocation,
  whole-device revocation, pruning, and bounded secret-free audit records.
- **HTTP and WebSocket gate** - applies the same authenticated-owner and exact
  origin rules to normal requests and live connections, validates hosts and
  trusted proxies, and keeps webhook and launcher-control secrets separate.
- **Neutral public boundary** - exposes only minimal health/connect responses to
  unauthenticated callers and prevents invitation, cookie, credential, instance,
  and forwarded-origin details from leaking through errors or logs.
- **Remote Access settings** - adds route status, invitation creation, LAN bind
  controls, current-browser logout, connected devices, active sessions, and
  immediate revocation from both full and compact layouts.
- **Managed private HTTPS** - adds explicit Tailscale detection, reviewed plan
  and apply steps, owned-route conflict/rollback handling, restart-aware policy
  refresh, and precise cleanup of only Row-Bot-managed Serve routes.
- **Browser-local voice** - records in the authenticated browser, transcribes
  locally, and returns session-scoped local speech without starting the host
  microphone service or retaining browser media.
- **Transactional migration and recovery** - preserves legacy mobile owner
  sessions and the existing access database path, and includes the database
  family in backup, restore, and launcher recovery flows.

### Docker, VPS & Secret Persistence

- **Official server image** - adds a locked, multi-stage, non-root image with
  browser support, OCI version/revision labels, a persistent `/data` boundary,
  and a server health probe for amd64 and arm64.
- **Hardened Compose baseline** - publishes to loopback by default, runs with a
  read-only root filesystem, drops capabilities, enables
  `no-new-privileges`, bounds logs, uses tmpfs for ephemeral paths, and provides
  persistent data and secrets volumes.
- **Automatic credential persistence** - initializes an encryption key once in
  the isolated secrets volume and stores provider credentials as encrypted
  records so container replacement does not require re-entering account keys or
  fall back to plaintext.
- **Deployment variants** - adds release-image, source-build, VPS host-network,
  read-only secret-directory, host Caddy, and systemd examples with explicit
  public origins, trusted proxies, and multiple-instance isolation.
- **Complete operator runbook** - documents first invitation, health checks,
  private knowledge model setup, backup/restore, upgrade/rollback, remote voice,
  Tailscale, session recovery, deliberate removal, and credential preservation.
- **Container-aware Developer safety** - refuses nested Docker Sandbox execution
  inside the official container and never silently falls back from a requested
  missing sandbox to local host execution.
- **Owned-resource smoke tests** - adds a deterministic server smoke runner that
  uses a random loopback port, never pulls or builds, redacts secrets, and cleans
  only the exact labeled container and volume it created.
- **Release-only container publication** - verifies native amd64 and arm64
  images on relevant changes, checks release tag/commit identity, smokes images
  before registry login or push, then assembles GHCR multi-architecture version
  manifests and publishes `latest` only for final releases.
- **Reproducible docs publication** - pins the docs build environment,
  regenerates LLM exports before Docusaurus, and normalizes generated artifact
  line endings.

### Mobile, Website & Data Integrity

- **Private startup default restored** - resolves an unspecified bind host to
  direct loopback again while continuing to honor intentional LAN, proxy, and
  server configuration.
- **Safer pairing recovery** - records access-gate rejections and replaces a
  failed or spent pairing form with explicit recovery guidance so it cannot be
  submitted again.
- **Cleaner mobile conversations** - removes internal child-agent threads from
  Recent chats while preserving orchestration activity on the owning parent.
- **Narrow-screen composer fix** - contains the action row, truncates the model
  control, preserves the send button, and respects left, right, and bottom safe
  areas.
- **Evergreen marketing surface** - refreshes the public landing experience with
  progressive enhancement, device-aware desktop install choices, explicit
  mobile/server handoff, complete non-JavaScript fallbacks, and responsive
  navigation.
- **Canonical site navigation** - unifies landing, Features, Architecture,
  Contact, 404, and documentation navigation, metadata, footers, download
  destinations, sitemap entries, and shared assets while removing duplicate
  Docusaurus shadow pages.
- **Wiki Vault ID preservation** - quotes entity IDs in frontmatter and always
  parses `id` as text, preventing numeric-looking IDs from being coerced while
  remaining compatible with legacy unquoted files.

### Tests & Release Validation

- **Orchestration contracts** - covers schema repair, parent/child waves,
  dependencies, capacity, joins, ordered events, approvals, steering, retries,
  stopping, checkpoint identity, exactly-once delivery, and restart recovery.
- **Cross-surface regressions** - verifies Agent cards, transcripts, activity,
  Goals, Workflows, channels, Buddy, voice, Developer, Designer, mobile, and
  filesystem confirmation against the durable runtime.
- **Document durability tests** - covers upload bounds, hashing, deduplication,
  queue transitions, leases, cancellation, restart recovery, sharded publication,
  deterministic retrieval, resumable extraction, and once-only finalization.
- **Access security tests** - covers invitation races, cookie isolation, session
  renewal/revocation, HTTP/WebSocket parity, trusted proxy rules, single-owner
  authority, migrations, backups, Tailscale ownership, and redaction.
- **Container release contracts** - validates Dockerfile/Compose hardening,
  secret persistence, Developer container boundaries, smoke ownership, native
  architecture builds, release identity, and manifest publication order.
- **Documentation contracts** - verifies the Docker and remote-access runbooks,
  canonical marketing routes, mobile handoff, internal links, generated
  references, LLM exports, sitemap ownership, and Pages synchronization.

### Breaking Changes And Caveats

- Every authenticated remote browser is the full Row-Bot owner. Invitation
  links and active browser sessions therefore carry the same authority as the
  local desktop and should be created, shared, and revoked accordingly.
- `row-bot serve` does not grant implicit owner access merely because a request
  arrives from loopback. Create an invitation with `row-bot access invite` and
  authenticate the browser; direct desktop mode retains its local-owner path.
- Direct LAN mode uses unencrypted HTTP. Prefer Tailscale Serve or a correctly
  configured HTTPS reverse proxy outside a trusted private network, and set the
  exact public origin, allowed hosts, and trusted proxy CIDRs.
- Browser microphone capture requires a secure context. Remote voice therefore
  needs HTTPS except for browser-recognized local origins, and local voice model
  downloads remain explicit.
- Docker upgrades must preserve both the data volume and the secrets volume.
  Losing or changing the secrets-volume encryption key makes encrypted account
  credentials unreadable; backing up only `/data` is not a complete credential
  backup.
- Docker Sandbox mode is intentionally unavailable from inside the official
  Row-Bot container. Use an explicitly reviewed local mounted-workspace mode or
  run Developer Studio from the host when isolated Docker execution is needed.
- Document uploads are limited to 256 MiB each and require at least 2 GiB of
  staging free space. Cloud embedding or extraction providers receive document
  chunks only when the user has selected those providers.
- The GHCR image and multi-architecture version manifest become available when
  the GitHub release is published. `latest` is updated only for a non-prerelease
  release; release-pinned Compose deployments should use `4.6.0`.
- Published docs under `docs/assets`, `docs/docs`, `docs/img`, `docs/pagefind`,
  and `docs/search` remain generated artifacts. Update their source and run the
  documented synchronization flow instead of editing them directly.
- Windows signing, macOS notarization, clean-machine installer and container
  smoke tests, previous-version updater checks, and real provider/channel/MCP,
  remote-access, Tailscale, voice, and Computer Use validation remain manual
  release gates after CI artifacts are built.

## v4.5.0 - Secure Computer Use, Agent Budgets & Public Documentation

This release builds on v4.4.0 with a native-computer-control, agent-safety,
local-retrieval, and documentation pass. It adds an opt-in Computer Use beta
for native Windows and macOS applications, introduces checkpoint-safe work
budgets and configurable child-agent capacity, makes local embedding recall
recover cleanly when a cached model is unavailable or still loading, hardens
browser and live-control isolation, and publishes a comprehensive searchable
user guide with reviewed screenshots and machine-readable references.

### Native Computer Use (Beta)

- **Native application control** - adds a provider-neutral `computer_use` tool
  for launching allowlisted applications, selecting one target window, reading
  its accessibility tree or screenshot, clicking, typing, pressing keys,
  scrolling, and dragging in native desktop interfaces.
- **Browser remains separate** - keeps DOM-based browser automation as the
  preferred path for websites and routes native applications and operating
  system dialogs through the new Computer Use engine instead.
- **Task-scoped exclusive sessions** - gives one interactive local task an
  exclusive Computer Use lease covering discovery, capture, optional Vision
  fallback, and input, preventing overlapping agents from controlling the
  desktop at the same time.
- **Generation-bound targeting** - uses opaque target and element tokens that
  expire after observations, reconnects, approvals, target drift, and user
  takeover so stale coordinates or accessibility nodes cannot be replayed.
- **Live control card** - shows the active application, bounded ephemeral
  preview, current state, and direct Stop, Take over, and Resume controls in
  chat while shielding the preview during user or approval handoff.
- **Human takeover** - cancels queued mutations before handing control to the
  user, retains the paused lease, and requires a fresh target-window
  observation before automation can resume.
- **Point-of-risk approvals** - classifies routine and consequential desktop
  actions, always confirms foreground escalation and sensitive consequences,
  and hands credentials, OTPs, CAPTCHAs, biometrics, UAC/TCC, terminals,
  password managers, and secure desktops back to the user.
- **Vision fallback** - can send an ephemeral target-window screenshot to the
  configured Vision provider only when accessibility information is
  insufficient, with the active local or cloud disclosure shown in Settings.
- **Interactive-only boundary** - keeps Computer Use unavailable to schedules,
  channels, background workflows, child agents, headless/server callers, and
  plugin or general MCP exposure.

### Computer Use Setup, Privacy & Recovery

- **Off-by-default setup** - adds a state-driven Settings flow for enablement,
  installation, health checks, a Calculator verification run, repair,
  reinstall, removal, and an explicitly configured reviewed system binary.
- **Reviewed Cua runtime** - pins Cua Driver Rust 0.7.1 for Windows x86-64,
  Windows ARM64, and macOS universal, downloads it only after an explicit
  Install action, verifies the platform SHA-256, and extracts it into Row-Bot's
  private data directory without invoking the upstream installer or updater.
- **Mandatory telemetry disclosure** - requires Continue or Cancel before any
  Cua executable invocation and documents the reviewed upstream telemetry
  fields and endpoint; Row-Bot still adds no first-party telemetry.
- **Narrow driver allowlist** - exposes only the reviewed application,
  target-window observation, input, health, permission, configuration, and
  session operations while blocking recording, desktop-wide capture, CDP,
  arbitrary configuration, updates, autostart, telemetry mutation, skills,
  process control, and maintenance surfaces.
- **Ephemeral sensitive data** - excludes typed values from logs, history,
  checkpoints, approval payloads, memory, and durable media, and does not
  persist target-window screenshots.
- **macOS permission recovery** - detects missing Accessibility and Screen
  Recording access, explains the recovery steps, links directly to the
  relevant Privacy & Security panes, and rechecks readiness after permissions
  are granted or the app is re-added.
- **Runtime readiness diagnostics** - distinguishes disabled, disclosure,
  install, permission, test, ready, repair, and unsupported states with
  actionable, non-technical recovery guidance.

### Agent Runtime Budgets & Delegation

- **Checkpoint-safe work budgets** - gives every new logical agent turn an
  explicit model-iteration budget, charges one round per successful model
  response, persists progress through interrupts, and derives the LangGraph
  recursion ceiling from remaining capacity.
- **Graceful budget completion** - reserves an exactly-once, tool-free final
  response when the work-round budget is exhausted instead of surfacing a raw
  recursion error or leaving the run in an ambiguous state.
- **Repeated-action protection** - detects identical tool requests without
  storing their arguments, blocks the fourth repeat, and terminates continued
  no-progress loops on the fifth request.
- **Configurable runtime limits** - adds Settings controls for maximum work
  rounds, nested agent levels, active children per parent, active children
  across the app, and an optional child active-time limit.
- **Reviewed defaults** - starts new runs with 90 work rounds, one child level,
  three active children per parent, eight active children application-wide,
  and no child timeout.
- **Queued child capacity** - queues excess child agents in order until both
  parent and global capacity are available instead of rejecting them, while
  preserving Stop behavior for queued work.
- **Run snapshots and progress** - snapshots effective settings into durable
  Agent Run rows, records safe model-iteration counters and heartbeats, and
  keeps active runs on the limits they started with when Settings change.
- **Optional active-time timeout** - applies the configured child limit only
  while a child is executing, excludes queue time, and records a clear terminal
  timeout reason.

### Local Embeddings & Memory Recall Reliability

- **Working first-run default** - clearly discloses and selects the recommended
  private knowledge model download during first-run setup (about 700 MB), while
  preserving an opt-out and keeping ordinary recall cache-only.
- **Bounded model payload** - excludes unused GGUF, ONNX, and OpenVINO exports
  from local embedding downloads so the default setup fetches the runtime files
  Row-Bot uses instead of the full multi-format model repository.
- **Strict cache-only runtime** - resolves local embedding models from the
  existing Hugging Face cache and sets local-only loading so normal recall,
  indexing, status checks, and startup cannot trigger a surprise model
  download.
- **Explicit download and repair** - keeps network access behind the user-run
  local-model download or repair action and reports whether the selected model
  is cached, missing, loading, ready, or failed.
- **Shared background loading** - coalesces concurrent recall callers onto one
  local embedding load and gives the first recall a bounded grace period rather
  than starting duplicate model loads.
- **Fast deterministic fallback** - remembers missing, failed, or timed-out
  local-model state so later recall attempts fail fast and continue through
  bounded lexical and graph retrieval instead of stalling the response.
- **Visible fallback notice** - emits one safe per-generation notice explaining
  when semantic memory search fell back and points to the local model setup
  action without exposing memory content.
- **Recall diagnostics** - records semantic status, fallback code, wait time,
  retrieval-stage timings, selected counts, and bounded ranking details for
  troubleshooting.
- **Workflow-safe retrieval** - applies the same bounded fallback to agent
  turns and workflow knowledge lookups while preserving existing provenance,
  ranking, and no-mutation recall policy.

### Browser & Interactive Control Hardening

- **Thread and task isolation** - scopes browser tabs and live-control state to
  their owning thread/task and cleans them up when work finishes or a thread is
  removed.
- **Navigation policy** - validates browser destinations and redirects before
  mutation so unsafe or out-of-scope navigation cannot silently broaden an
  agent's authority.
- **Consequence-aware actions** - applies shared approval and consequence
  classification to browser mutations while keeping observation and control
  state explicit.
- **History redaction** - prevents sensitive typed values and unsafe action
  details from leaking into durable browser history or tool traces.
- **Cancellation and readiness** - makes browser operations responsive to Stop,
  reports unavailable runtimes clearly, and keeps takeover/resume state
  consistent with Computer Use.
- **MCP result isolation** - normalizes private Computer Use MCP results without
  registering its driver as a general MCP server or exposing unreviewed tools.

### Public Documentation & Website

- **Comprehensive user guide** - expands the Docusaurus site with concepts,
  request lifecycle, profiles/goals/agents, workflows, integrations, extension
  trust, operations, mobile/native guidance, knowledge provenance and repair,
  wiki vault, settings, and reference pages.
- **Control-level Settings reference** - generates a searchable inventory of
  visible Settings controls, defaults, declared ranges, dependencies, restart
  notes, security notes, and source locations.
- **Reviewed UI screenshot library** - refreshes desktop Settings and Home
  images and adds chat, approval, tool trace, profiles, workflows, Developer,
  Designer, Skills Hub, Plugin Marketplace, MCP, and mobile screenshots from an
  isolated neutral demonstration profile.
- **Safe capture automation** - refuses the normal Row-Bot data directory,
  disables background autostart and network status checks, seeds display-only
  provider/channel/plugin/MCP states, and validates screenshot review metadata.
- **Searchable static publication** - adds Pagefind search, committed GitHub
  Pages output under `docs/`, a generated sitemap, and structural validation of
  the published search artifacts.
- **Machine-readable docs** - publishes `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` alongside
  the human documentation and links them from the docs footer.
- **Docs CI coverage** - regenerates inventories and LLM files, checks generated
  references, validates screenshots and source, builds the review report and
  Docusaurus site, runs docs tests, and verifies the committed Pages artifact.
- **Publication synchronization** - adds a deterministic sync command that
  refreshes only generated documentation assets while preserving the
  hand-curated marketing homepage, feature pages, contact form, analytics, and
  shared site assets.
- **Navigation and mobile fixes** - restores reliable Home/Docs navigation,
  aligns the landing, feature, architecture, and contact pages, and improves
  responsive layouts without changing the desktop visual system.
- **Maintenance contract** - documents the authoritative UI coverage map,
  screenshot capture/review workflow, publication steps, and generated-file
  ownership, with repository attributes marking built docs as generated.

### Tests & Release Validation

- **Computer Use contracts** - adds deterministic fake-driver coverage for the
  private client, allowlist, leases, observation tokens, actions, approvals,
  cancellation, takeover, text privacy, Vision fallback, readiness, runtime
  manifest, installer package data, and UI state.
- **Agent budget coverage** - tests checkpoint schema, iteration charging,
  repeated-action termination, exactly-once finalization, settings validation,
  FIFO capacity queues, nesting limits, active-time timeout, and durable run
  progress.
- **Browser regressions** - adds focused cancellation, consequence, redaction,
  live-control, navigation, readiness, and tab-isolation tests.
- **Embedding regressions** - covers cache-only model resolution, shared loads,
  missing/failed/timeout fast paths, explicit repair downloads, fallback
  notices, recall timing, workflow knowledge lookup, and bounded ranking.
- **Documentation automation tests** - validates source coverage, screenshot
  metadata, generated references, Pagefind artifact structure, Pages sync, and
  cross-platform path handling.

### Breaking Changes And Caveats

- Computer Use is a beta, is off by default, and supports reviewed Windows and
  macOS artifacts only. Linux, unattended/background automation, channels,
  schedules, workflows, child agents, and headless callers are not supported.
- Enabling Computer Use requires accepting the separate Cua Driver telemetry
  disclosure. Cua telemetry is third-party behavior, not Row-Bot telemetry;
  canceling the disclosure leaves the tool disabled and does not install or run
  Cua.
- The Computer Use component is downloaded on demand and therefore needs
  network access for initial install or repair. Normal use runs the verified
  private local executable with its updater disabled.
- macOS users must grant Accessibility and Screen Recording access to the
  relevant Row-Bot/Cua application entries. Permission changes may require the
  app entry to be removed, re-added, and rechecked.
- Local embedding models are never downloaded implicitly during recall or
  ordinary startup. First-run setup clearly discloses and selects the
  recommended private knowledge model download by default, with an opt-out. If
  it is skipped or later damaged, use the explicit Settings action; recall
  continues with lexical/graph fallback in the meantime.
- Agent runtime limit changes apply only to new runs. A low work-round or child
  active-time limit can stop long tasks before they finish, while queued child
  time does not count toward the active-time limit.
- Published docs under `docs/assets`, `docs/docs`, `docs/img`, `docs/pagefind`,
  and `docs/search` are generated artifacts. Update their source and run the
  documented synchronization flow instead of editing them directly.
- Windows signing, macOS notarization, clean-machine artifact smoke tests,
  previous-version updater checks, and real provider/channel/MCP/Computer Use
  validation remain manual release gates after CI artifacts are built.

## v4.4.0 - Mobile Companion, Channel Streaming & Runtime Reliability

This release builds on v4.3.0 with a mobile-access, messaging, provider, and
runtime-reliability pass. It adds a secure browser-first mobile companion,
brings live agent streaming and interactive approvals to external channels,
surfaces child-agent approvals and completion notices in parent conversations,
makes Stop cancel stalled provider streams and subprocess-backed tools, restores
automatic model discovery with last-known-good catalog protection, hardens
Gemini tool-schema compatibility and Google Calendar concurrency, and expands
the recommended MCP catalog with Xquik.

### Mobile Web Companion

- **Phone-native shell** - adds a full-screen mobile interface with Chat,
  Activity, Workflows, Knowledge, and Settings navigation instead of shrinking
  the desktop drawers and studio chrome onto a phone display.
- **Mobile chat workflow** - adds conversation list/detail views, new-thread
  creation, attachments, skills, profile and model controls, generation status,
  and a persistent Stop control using the same durable threads as desktop.
- **Activity and approvals** - shows active chat generations, running workflows,
  recent workflow runs, tool approvals, and workflow approvals in one phone-safe
  surface with approve, deny, and stop actions.
- **Mobile workflow editor** - supports simple prompt workflows, schedules,
  profiles, model overrides, approval policy, persistent threads, channel
  delivery, enablement, and metadata while preserving advanced graph steps for
  desktop editing.
- **Mobile-safe settings** - adds stacked provider status and credential
  summaries, local skill enable/pin controls, and installed plugin enablement.
  Skills Hub and Plugin Marketplace installation/configuration remain desktop
  actions in Mobile V1.
- **Installable web app** - adds a PWA manifest, service worker, install
  metadata, and offline page while deliberately excluding authenticated and
  private Row-Bot surfaces from service-worker caching.
- **Mobile Access settings** - adds route discovery and phone pairing under
  Settings -> System for local-network access, optional Tailscale direct or
  Serve routes, an existing ngrok tunnel, and advanced custom origins.
- **QR pairing and device control** - creates short-lived single-use QR links,
  stores session tokens in HttpOnly cookies, lists paired phones and access
  events, and lets an authorized user revoke a phone immediately.
- **Remote access gate** - protects remote HTTP and WebSocket traffic while
  keeping direct loopback desktop access open, rejecting forwarded-header
  localhost bypasses, and redirecting unpaired remote clients to pairing.
- **Local-first auth storage** - stores hashed pairing and device secrets,
  device scopes, revocation state, failed-attempt lockouts, and display-safe
  audit events in a dedicated local SQLite database.

### Channel Streaming, Approvals & Delivery

- **Shared streaming engine** - adds deterministic token and tool-event
  delivery with coalesced edits, typing keepalives, bounded previews,
  rate-limit-aware retries, platform-safe splitting, preview cleanup, and final
  send fallback when an edit cannot be completed.
- **Discord streaming** - streams through edited messages, keeps typing active,
  splits long final answers, retries with a fresh final message when necessary,
  and presents interactive approval buttons.
- **Slack native streaming** - uses Slack's native stream APIs when available
  and appropriate, falls back to edited messages when they are not, and adds
  Block Kit approval actions plus bounded retry-after handling.
- **Telegram draft streaming** - uses native message drafts for supported
  private chats, falls back to edit streaming elsewhere, respects UTF-16 message
  limits, and adds inline approve/deny controls.
- **WhatsApp and SMS behavior** - adds WhatsApp edit streaming, typing, split
  finals, and approval resume. SMS intentionally remains final-text-only with
  safe chunking and explicit YES/NO approval handling.
- **Goal Mode and plugin channels** - routes normal turns, Goal Mode turns,
  interrupted/resumed turns, and plugin-owned channel turns through the shared
  delivery path without duplicate final responses.
- **Checkpoint repair** - persists delivered assistant answers when a channel
  checkpoint contains only the human turn, without duplicating an assistant
  message already written by the agent graph.
- **Durable terminal notices** - delivers compact, once-only child-agent and
  Goal Mode completion/failure notices, retains failed notices for retry, and
  reconciles them when configured channels start again.

### Child Agents, Approvals & Generation Control

- **Parent-thread approval surfacing** - appends durable, deduplicated child
  agent approval requests to the parent conversation so background work cannot
  wait invisibly.
- **Clear approval reasons** - prefers the model-supplied reason in approval
  cards, redacts and bounds display text, and retains the raw action payload for
  the actual safety decision.
- **Shell and Developer rationale** - adds an explicit approval-reason field to
  shell and Developer commands so requested command execution can explain why
  it is needed.
- **Child-agent lifecycle messages** - preserves direct and delegated run
  metadata, completion summaries, queued-turn ordering, checkpoint reloads, and
  once-only rendering across parent and child conversations.
- **Shared cancellation scope** - links an active generation to provider
  requests, subprocesses, tool waits, and its spawned child runs so Stop has one
  consistent cancellation path.
- **Stalled provider cancellation** - closes in-flight direct OpenAI,
  Anthropic, xAI, MiniMax, OpenRouter, OpenCode, subscription, and compatible
  transport responses so a blocked network stream no longer leaves a thread
  stuck in Thinking.
- **Tool and process cancellation** - extends Stop to shell commands, Developer
  processes, MCP probes and calls, browser operations, voice turns, and other
  subprocess-backed work, with a clear stopped result where appropriate.
- **Scoped child cancellation** - stops only child runs linked to the cancelled
  generation and wakes/detaches queued generation state without terminating
  unrelated agent work.

### Providers, Models & Tool Schemas

- **Automatic catalog discovery restored** - returns Codex and other registered
  providers to targeted and scheduled model refreshes, including discovery of
  newly available subscription models.
- **Last-known-good catalogs** - preserves provider-specific cached rows when a
  refresh is empty, fails, or loses a later pagination page, and replaces only
  rows for a provider whose refresh completed successfully.
- **Visible catalog provenance** - reports live, cached, and fallback outcomes
  in provider settings so a retained catalog is distinguishable from a fresh
  provider response.
- **Provider-scoped schema policy** - adds a compatibility inspector for tool
  input schemas without rewriting the tools used by unaffected transports.
- **Gemini array compatibility** - checks the effective Google adapter output
  for typed array `items`, filters optional incompatible tools while preserving
  order, and fails clearly when an explicitly requested tool is incompatible.
- **Built-in schema repairs** - gives Gmail recipient arrays and Goal
  evidence/blocker arrays concrete item types while continuing to normalize
  legacy scalar or structured inputs safely.
- **Provider matrix coverage** - expands deterministic and opt-in live-provider
  policy checks for catalog ownership, pagination, routing, current-model
  discovery, media capability, and tool-schema conversion.

### Google Calendar & MCP

- **Request-scoped Calendar clients** - creates an independent Google Calendar
  service for each operation so concurrent tool calls do not share an unsafe
  client instance.
- **Safe concurrent OAuth refresh** - makes Calendar token refresh single-flight
  and atomic when several operations discover an expired token together.
- **Serialized mutations and bulk create** - orders same-turn writes and adds a
  native multi-event create operation that preserves result order and reports
  partial failures clearly.
- **Retry and reconciliation** - retries transient SSL and backend failures with
  fresh services, returns structured permanent errors, and reconciles ambiguous
  timeouts so a backend-committed event is not created twice.
- **Typed Calendar operations** - preserves search, create, update, move, and
  delete while exposing typed attendee, conference, timezone, notification,
  calendar, and bulk-event inputs.
- **Xquik MCP catalog entry** - adds Xquik for X/Twitter data access through
  streamable HTTP with API-key header setup, capability metadata, and explicit
  high-risk approval guidance for its generic executor.
- **MCP configuration integrity** - preserves marketplace metadata when an
  installed server is edited, refreshes cached agent tools after MCP changes,
  normalizes interrupted probes, and avoids repeatedly restarting failed
  servers until an explicit refresh.
- **Generated reference refresh** - updates public generated references for the
  expanded channel, mobile, MCP, provider, approval, settings, storage, and tool
  inventories.

### UI Fixes, Tests & Release Validation

- **Active-thread spinner restored** - returns the sidebar generation spinner
  to the active thread and limits it to genuinely streaming state while
  preserving pinned-thread and recency ordering.
- **Mobile test coverage** - adds deterministic subsystem and integration tests
  for pairing, cookies, access gating, remote routes, PWA privacy, Tailscale,
  chat, workflows, settings, and mobile-shell routing.
- **Channel test coverage** - adds transport and shared-engine tests for edit
  cadence, native fallback, typing, rate limits, overflow, message splitting,
  approvals, checkpoint persistence, Goal Mode, terminal notifications, and
  plugin-channel delivery.
- **Cancellation test coverage** - adds focused tests for provider HTTP
  cancellation, subprocess termination, generation Stop, shell, browser, MCP,
  Developer, voice, and generation-linked child agents.
- **Provider and tool coverage** - adds model-catalog failure/pagination tests,
  Gemini schema contracts, Gmail and Goal schemas, Xquik configuration, and
  Google Calendar concurrency, retry, reconciliation, and bulk-create tests.
- **Run and approval regressions** - expands coverage for queued control
  messages, child-agent lifecycle cards, approval display safety, thread titles,
  tool filtering, and active-run rendering.

### Breaking Changes And Caveats

- Mobile is a companion to a running Row-Bot host, not a separate cloud-hosted
  service. The desktop host must remain running and reachable through the
  selected local network, Tailscale, ngrok, or custom route.
- Remote routes are pairing-gated, but exposing Row-Bot through a public tunnel
  still makes the pairing endpoint internet-reachable. Keep tunnel URLs and
  short-lived pairing links private, review access events, and revoke devices
  that are no longer trusted.
- Mobile V1 does not expose Developer Studio, Designer Studio, Skills Hub
  install/create flows, Plugin Marketplace install/configure/update flows, or
  every advanced workflow graph control. Those remain desktop-only.
- Channel streaming depends on platform capabilities and configuration. Slack
  and Telegram fall back to edit streaming when native streaming is unavailable;
  SMS remains final-text-only by design, and long messages may arrive in parts.
- Gemini now filters optional tools whose effective schemas contain untyped
  arrays. If an incompatible tool was explicitly selected, agent creation fails
  with a schema error instead of sending a request Gemini will reject.
- Xquik's generic executor remains classified high risk. Review its requested
  action and metered/private-data implications before approving it.
- Windows signing, macOS notarization, clean-machine artifact smoke tests,
  previous-version updater checks, and real provider/channel/MCP validation
  remain manual release gates after CI artifacts are built.

## v4.3.0 - Plugin System v2, Requesty, Prompt Cache & Release Hardening

This release builds on v4.2.0 with a broad extension, provider, workflow, and
release-readiness pass. It completes Plugin System v2, adds plugin-owned
channels and marketplace tooling, introduces Requesty as a first-class
provider, makes prompt context and Anthropic prompt-cache behavior explicit,
moves workflows to profile-first agent execution, adds Developer Studio
worktrees, replaces the macOS tray fallback with a native tray host, removes
the old Thoth rebrand migration from startup, and hardens CI, dependency, and
installer validation before the 4.3.0 release.

### Plugin System v2 & Marketplace

- **Manifest v2 contract** - defines `schema_version: 2` plugin manifests with
  supported extension surfaces for native tools, plugin-packaged MCP servers,
  bundled skills, and channels.
- **Declarative plugin metadata** - adds validation for plugin IDs, versions,
  minimum Row-Bot versions, permissions, settings, secrets, auth declarations,
  health checks, and supported `provides` entries.
- **Plugin API expansion** - extends `plugins.api` with public tool, channel,
  attachment, outbound callback, result, settings, secret, webhook, pairing,
  allowlist, and health-check helpers so plugins can integrate without
  importing Row-Bot internals.
- **Native Plugin Center** - expands the in-app plugin UI to render metadata,
  permissions, settings, secrets, auth status, health checks, tools, channels,
  bundled skills, logs, marketplace updates, enablement, reload, and uninstall
  controls from Row-Bot-owned UI.
- **Marketplace install/update flow** - adds cached marketplace indexes,
  checksum-aware local or remote installs, stale-cache fallback, installed
  version/update metadata, disabled-by-default installation, and immediate
  runtime refresh after plugin changes.
- **Plugin developer tools** - adds plugin linking, reload, doctor, validation,
  local marketplace index generation, devtool helpers, and examples for native
  tools, settings/secrets, MCP-backed tools, and fake channels.
- **Plugin templates** - adds native-tool, MCP-tool, and channel templates under
  `src/row_bot/plugins/templates/` for repeatable plugin authoring.
- **Plugin safety sandbox** - tightens loader validation around dangerous
  constructs, unsupported extension surfaces, UI framework imports, Row-Bot
  internal imports, old Thoth manifests, stale code, plugin dependencies, and
  runtime refresh behavior.
- **Plugin skill scoping** - keeps plugin-provided skills tied to plugin
  enablement and Agent Profile tool boundaries, so selected-tool profiles do
  not receive unrelated plugin instructions.
- **Plugin MCP bridge** - lets plugin-packaged MCP server declarations follow
  plugin enablement and appear or disappear with the owning plugin's runtime
  inventory.

### Plugin Channels, Messaging & Bot Auth

- **Public plugin channel runtime** - adds a core bridge that lets plugin-owned
  channels route inbound messages through Row-Bot's normal channel, agent,
  Goal Mode, approval, media, and generated-file delivery paths.
- **Plugin channel attachment handling** - reuses the shared channel media
  pipeline for plugin-channel audio transcription, image analysis, document
  extraction, inbox persistence, workspace copy, size limits, and generated
  image/video/file delivery.
- **Plugin webhooks** - adds namespaced plugin webhook registration under
  `/plugin-webhooks/{plugin_id}/{name}`, with webhook handlers disabled when
  the owning plugin is disabled, unloaded, uninstalled, or fails load.
- **Bot Framework auth helpers** - adds plugin-facing helpers for Bot Framework
  JWT validation, OpenID/JWKS discovery, issuer/audience checks, and
  display-safe failure reporting.
- **Channel registry integration** - teaches the channel registry and tool
  factory how to include plugin-owned channels while preserving native channel
  capability checks and generated send/photo/document tools.
- **Thread-scoped channel commands** - fixes Telegram model switching and
  related channel commands so model changes stay scoped to the active channel
  thread instead of leaking across conversations.
- **Channel output assembly** - centralizes channel answer/tool-report assembly
  so plugin and native channel responses have the same readable final shape.
- **Channel UI polish** - refreshes channel monitor and sidebar status surfaces
  so running native and plugin channels stay visible without crowding the
  conversation list.

### Providers, Prompt Context & Workflow Agents

- **Requesty provider** - adds Requesty as a first-class OpenAI-compatible
  provider with provider definition, setup/settings support, auth mapping,
  catalog URL handling, provider-qualified refs, and routing through the shared
  OpenAI-compatible transport.
- **Requesty catalog normalization** - maps Requesty's `context_window`,
  `supports_tool_calling`, `supports_reasoning`, `supports_vision`,
  modality, task, and metadata fields into Row-Bot capability snapshots.
- **Requesty surface filtering** - filters embedding, audio, image, video,
  moderation, realtime, and other non-chat Requesty rows out of Brain/agent
  surfaces while preserving vision and tool-capable chat models.
- **Provider credential dialogs** - moves provider credential collection into
  row-specific dialogs so Settings can avoid exposing or confusing unrelated
  provider secret fields.
- **Provider selection hardening** - improves provider resolution, catalog
  cache behavior, readiness checks, and Quick Choice compatibility for
  provider-qualified refs, Requesty, xAI OAuth, and existing providers.
- **Explicit prompt context contract** - splits prompt assembly into named
  stable and ephemeral sections so identity, profile, platform, self-knowledge,
  tools, skills, plugins, background overrides, memory recall, date/time,
  Developer, Designer, channel, and history context have deterministic cache
  behavior.
- **Anthropic prompt-cache markers** - applies Anthropic `cache_control`
  markers only to eligible stable system content for the direct Anthropic API,
  while keeping conversation history and ephemeral turn data unmarked.
- **Prompt cache metrics** - normalizes provider prompt-cache read/write token
  counts across common metadata shapes for diagnostics and status reporting.
- **Profile-first workflow agents** - migrates workflows toward Agent Profile
  execution, maps compatible legacy workflow policies to built-in or generated
  profiles, preserves review/blocked status when policy cannot be mapped, and
  surfaces migration notes in workflow editing.
- **Workflow profile defaults** - adds a default workflow Agent Profile path so
  new workflows start from explicit profile policy rather than implicit legacy
  skill/tool snapshots.

### Developer Studio, UI & Desktop Polish

- **Developer worktrees** - adds durable per-thread, child-agent, and workflow
  worktree allocation with owner records, branch naming, base branch/commit
  tracking, cleanup state, metadata, and failure preservation.
- **Worktree seeding** - can seed a Developer worktree from current staged,
  unstaged, and untracked changes or from the last commit, while requiring a
  real Git repository root and safe path handling.
- **Developer workspace UI refresh** - reorganizes Developer Studio around
  workspace identity, thread selection, profile/run controls, branch controls,
  inspector panels, responsive layout, and safer overflow behavior.
- **Recent workspace visibility** - fixes Developer Studio so all recent
  workspaces can be shown instead of being hidden by an overly narrow recent
  list.
- **Sidebar pinning and thread actions** - adds thread pinning, places the pin
  toggle before other row actions, and updates thread action helpers so pinned
  chat and Developer threads sort predictably.
- **Natural progress updates** - improves long-running interactive status text
  so agent runs can report progress in a more human, less repetitive way while
  preserving durable run state.
- **Monochrome sidebar cleanup** - refreshes sidebar iconography, status
  badges, action placement, and monitor styling for a cleaner desktop shell.
- **Streaming/render reliability** - hardens streaming reattach, grouped tool
  trace rendering, final content persistence, generated media handling, and
  disconnected-client timer behavior across chat, Developer, workflows, and
  channels.
- **Native macOS tray host** - adds a native Objective-C macOS tray helper and
  launcher integration so packaged macOS tray content stays visible and uses
  platform-native status item behavior.
- **Startup speed and legacy cleanup** - removes the old automatic
  Thoth-to-Row-Bot rebrand migration and post-migration notice from the hot
  startup path, keeping current startup focused on Row-Bot data only.

### Docs, CI, Packaging & Supply Chain

- **Public docs completion pass** - completes the user-guide pass across
  Docusaurus docs, generated reference pages, settings/home/chat/integration
  pages, real UI screenshot metadata, Pagefind integration, and docs validation.
- **Plugin documentation** - adds the Plugin System v2 technical reference,
  authoring workflow, validation commands, marketplace fixture layout, and
  plugin test guidance.
- **Prompt cache documentation** - adds the prompt context/cache contract with
  stable/ephemeral section inventory, provider gating rules, and verification
  expectations.
- **Installer verification plan** - adds the installer and CI verification plan
  covering local pre-push checks, PR gates, manual Installer Verify workflow,
  release artifact builds, and deferred clean-machine smoke coverage.
- **Test matrix source of truth** - adds `scripts/run_test_matrix.py` with fast,
  contracts, subsystem, coverage, deterministic, installer, app-smoke, PR, and
  release lanes aligned with repository ownership rules.
- **Dependency discipline** - moves dependency truth to `pyproject.toml` and
  `uv.lock`, adds locked `requirements.txt` export/check tooling, uses uv for
  Dependabot updates, and verifies runtime extras before release builds.
- **Supply-chain CI** - adds UV lockfile, OSV scanner, lint advisory/blocking,
  live e2e, and installer verification workflows, with vulnerable-package
  baselines tracked in `osv-scanner.toml`.
- **Release workflow hardening** - updates release CI to run the release matrix,
  verify version consistency, build/smoke Windows, Linux, and macOS artifacts,
  upload SHA256 manifests, and keep Windows signing local-only.
- **Installer payload coverage** - updates Windows, macOS, and Linux builders,
  installer docs, dependency setup, source payload comments, macOS tray
  bundling, Linux smoke paths, and packaged runtime dependency checks.
- **Agent instructions** - adds canonical `AGENTS.md`, a Claude companion file,
  updated contribution guidance, and clearer PR-template release/test prompts.

### Tests & Release Validation

- **Plugin coverage** - adds contract and subsystem tests for manifest v2,
  plugin API, registry/loader, state, installer, marketplace, UI contracts,
  devtools, webhooks, bot auth, plugin channels, plugin MCP tools, and plugin
  skill scoping.
- **Channel coverage** - adds channel contracts, registry tests, approval
  tests, plugin-channel runtime tests, channel model routing tests, and
  streaming/tool-output coverage.
- **Provider coverage** - adds Requesty tests plus broader provider catalog,
  runtime, selection, prompt-cache metric, prompt-cache payload, API-key dialog,
  readiness, and optional dependency coverage.
- **Workflow coverage** - adds profile-first workflow runtime, migration,
  approvals, graph, delegate-agent step, and profile override coverage.
- **Developer coverage** - adds Developer import gate, runtime command/process,
  sandbox, inspector snapshot, worktree manager, workspace thread, and UI
  contract coverage.
- **Installer/release coverage** - adds installer metadata, CLI smoke,
  release workflow contract, coverage summary, test matrix runner, dependency
  metadata, optional import, Linux support, and app port/startup coverage.
- **Migrated subsystem coverage** - adds contracts, fixtures, helper packages,
  source-test maps, legacy inventory, coverage inventory, deterministic
  subsystem lanes, and many focused tests while keeping retired monolith shim
  files out of new substantive coverage.
- **Regression coverage** - adds focused tests for memory graph regressions,
  condition operators, workflow audit fixes, thread pinning, tool config
  isolation, UI home contracts, sidebar grouping, and startup hardening.

### Breaking Changes And Caveats

- Plugin System v2 intentionally supports only native tools, plugin-packaged
  MCP servers, bundled skills, and channels. Plugins cannot add arbitrary app
  panels, custom NiceGUI, JavaScript, provider runtimes, memory providers,
  workflow triggers, general hooks, or custom settings tabs.
- Plugin manifests must use `schema_version: 2` and `provides.native_tools`;
  old Thoth plugin manifests or plugin code that imports Row-Bot internals are
  rejected or quarantined instead of loaded.
- Plugins install disabled by default. Users must review permissions, configure
  required settings/secrets, run health checks where relevant, and enable the
  plugin before it contributes tools, skills, MCP servers, or channels.
- Plugin channel adapters route through Row-Bot core for execution, approvals,
  media, Goal Mode, pairing, and webhook lifecycle. URL-only attachments are
  not fetched by core through the public plugin API.
- Requesty uses provider id `requesty` and provider-qualified refs such as
  `model:requesty:provider/model`. Its catalog is filtered so non-chat media,
  audio, embedding, moderation, and realtime rows do not appear as Brain/agent
  choices.
- Direct Anthropic is the only provider receiving Anthropic prompt-cache
  markers in this rollout. Anthropic-compatible providers such as MiniMax,
  OpenCode Anthropic Messages, and Claude Subscription do not receive
  `cache_control` markers until explicitly proven compatible.
- Current Row-Bot startup no longer runs the old automatic Thoth-to-Row-Bot
  rebrand migration. Users still on Thoth or very early Row-Bot builds should
  first install and launch a previous migration-capable Row-Bot release, then
  upgrade to 4.3.0.
- Windows signing remains local-only, and macOS notarization plus final
  clean-machine Windows/macOS/Linux smoke tests are still manual release gates
  after release artifacts are built.

## v4.2.0 - Agent Profiles, Goal Mode, xAI Grok & Public Docs

This release builds on v4.1.0 with a larger orchestration and provider pass. It
introduces durable Agent Profiles, Goal Mode, child-agent delegation, first-class
xAI Grok OAuth support, Grok Imagine media generation, a new public docs site,
real UI documentation capture, and several provider/settings hardening fixes
that make model selection, OAuth status, and headless secret handling more
predictable.

### Agent Profiles, Goal Mode & Delegation

- **Agent Profiles runtime** - adds durable Agent Profiles with profile
  instructions, handoff contracts, usage guidance, tool policy, skill policy,
  context policy, workspace policy, approval policy, and enabled/disabled
  state.
- **Thread profile injection** - carries the active profile into normal agent
  runs and chat-only turns, including a structured profile prompt, policy
  summary, and warning path when a selected profile is missing or disabled.
- **Built-in profile library** - adds and refreshes built-in profiles for
  focused roles, including profile metadata, when-to-use guidance, tool
  constraints, and runtime snapshots used by child agents.
- **Profile commands and UI** - adds profile command handling, a Profile
  Library, profile picker, profile summaries, and profile-selection surfaces so
  users can choose or inspect an agent role without editing config files.
- **Goal Mode v1** - introduces durable per-thread goals with objective,
  status, progress, evidence, blockers, next step, turn count, active run id,
  and formatted status output.
- **Goal tool integration** - adds `goal_update` and `goal_status` tools so
  agents can report real progress, blockers, evidence, and completion state
  through the same durable Goal Mode record shown in the UI.
- **Child Agent runs** - adds durable child-agent runs with queued/running/
  terminal states, parent thread linkage, profile snapshots, context summaries,
  status messages, event logs, stop requests, and wait handling.
- **Agent delegation tools** - adds `delegate_work`, `agent_status`,
  `agent_wait`, `agent_stop`, `agent_profiles`, `agent_profile_save`,
  `agent_message`, and `agent_promote` for controlled multi-agent workflows.
- **Agent promotion paths** - lets completed child runs be promoted into a new
  Agent Profile or into a disabled manual workflow that can be reviewed before
  reuse.
- **Tool allowlists** - carries profile/tool allowlists into agent graph
  construction, plugin tools, and MCP tool injection so delegated work can be
  narrower than the parent thread's full tool surface.
- **Write-lock and queue safeguards** - adds active-run queue handling,
  single-writer protections, and approval coverage so child agents do not
  silently collide with parent work.
- **Activity and Goal UI** - adds Goal UI, Agent drawer, channel monitor
  surfaces, Command Center grouping, live profile/run status, and streaming
  updates for long-running delegated work.
- **Channel goal runtime** - extends channel command/runtime paths across
  Discord, Slack, SMS, Telegram, and WhatsApp so channel-driven work can carry
  goal and agent context consistently.

### xAI Grok OAuth Provider

- **xAI Grok first-class provider** - adds `xai_oauth` as a first-class,
  provider-qualified runtime for xAI Grok subscription access, separate from
  the existing xAI API-key provider.
- **OAuth PKCE support** - adds OAuth flow helpers, token storage, refresh
  handling, client-id status reporting, account/user/email hash metadata, and
  token health checks for the xAI Grok runtime.
- **xAI Responses transport** - adds a dedicated xAI OAuth Responses transport
  for chat/model runtime creation, prompt conversion, streaming behavior, and
  response normalization.
- **Model catalog integration** - wires xAI Grok into cloud model refresh,
  provider-qualified model refs, context-window lookup, model availability
  checks, cache entries, and status-only catalog reads.
- **Vision capability probing** - adds xAI OAuth vision probe support so
  vision-capable Grok models can be confirmed and reported instead of relying
  only on static assumptions.
- **Provider readiness and status** - adds runtime availability checks,
  provider status details, token-health timing, last runtime probe, last vision
  probe, model-count status, and OAuth client-id diagnostics.
- **Model picker integration** - adds xAI Grok provider labels, picker icons,
  inactive reasons, canonical provider refs, surface filtering, and short-lived
  provider-status caching for faster settings and picker rendering.
- **Setup and settings integration** - adds xAI Grok provider cards, connect
  state, setup-wizard copy, model settings rows, default handling, and
  provider-specific hardening in Settings.
- **Default/model-settings hardening** - fixes edge cases where xAI OAuth
  defaults, inactive provider state, or unsupported surfaces could leave model
  settings in a misleading state.

### Grok Imagine Media Generation

- **xAI OAuth media runtime** - adds Grok Imagine image and video generation
  through the OAuth-backed xAI Grok provider, including availability checks that
  use OAuth runtime status rather than API-key presence.
- **Curated Grok Imagine models** - adds `grok-imagine-image`,
  `grok-imagine-image-quality`, and `grok-imagine-video` options for xAI and
  xAI Grok media surfaces.
- **xAI media provider module** - adds a dedicated xAI media implementation for
  image, video, and image-to-video request construction and response handling.
- **Media picker filtering** - updates image and video model option builders so
  provider-qualified cache rows and OAuth-backed models appear only on
  compatible media surfaces.
- **Image/video tool integration** - updates image generation, video
  generation, and Row-Bot Status media reporting so xAI Grok media models are
  discoverable and diagnosable.
- **xAI API-key catalog improvements** - merges `/models` and
  `/language-models`, hides unusable rows, preserves curated chat extras, and
  exposes Grok Imagine media rows without leaking them into chat surfaces.
- **Image-to-video request fix** - fixes the xAI image-to-video request body so
  media generation requests match the provider's expected payload shape.

### Provider Secrets, Settings & Model Picker Reliability

- **Session-only secret fallback** - hardens provider secret handling when the
  OS keyring is unavailable, especially on WSL/headless Linux, by allowing
  newly entered secrets to work for the current process while keeping local
  metadata files secret-free.
- **Headless Linux guidance** - updates README and architecture docs to explain
  that persistent provider secrets need Secret Service, KWallet, or another
  secure Python keyring backend.
- **Custom endpoint auth errors** - improves custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  behavior when auth is required but no secret is available, returning a
  provider-specific message instead of silently falling through.
- **Provider settings feedback** - updates provider settings and setup wizard
  copy so unavailable keyring state, missing secrets, OAuth state, and provider
  readiness are surfaced more clearly.
- **Read-only picker path** - changes Quick Choice listing to avoid mutating
  provider config during ordinary picker reads, reducing settings churn and
  surprising writes.
- **Surface-aware inactive reasons** - annotates Quick Choices with clearer
  inactive reasons when a model is configured but unsupported on the requested
  chat, agent, vision, image, or video surface.
- **Provider status cache** - adds a short-lived picker cache for provider
  status checks so settings/model surfaces do not repeatedly refresh token
  health during one render pass.

### Public Docs, Website & Automation

- **4.1.0 landing page refresh** - updates the public landing page for the
  published v4.1.0 artifacts, refreshed provider positioning, social preview
  image, Linux install command, accessibility for video facades, and updated
  product demos.
- **Public docs site scaffold** - adds a Docusaurus-based docs site under
  `docs-site` with docs navigation, generated reference pages, custom styling,
  static architecture/contact pages, brand assets, favicon, CNAME, and package
  lockfile.
- **Docs content metadata** - adds structured metadata under `docs-content` for
  settings tabs, home tabs, dialogs, docs routes, UI surfaces, real UI
  surfaces, screenshots, how-to guides, and review status.
- **Real UI screenshots** - adds real app screenshot assets for app shell,
  chat, setup, home tabs, and settings tabs so docs show actual Row-Bot
  surfaces instead of placeholder illustrations.
- **Docs generation pipeline** - adds scripts for inventory collection, MDX
  generation, real UI docs generation, screenshot capture, demo data seeding,
  review report creation, `llms.txt` generation, schema helpers, and public
  docs validation.
- **Docs capture hooks** - adds app-side docs capture support so documentation
  scripts can drive and snapshot stable UI states.
- **Search and navigation** - adds Pagefind search integration, search page,
  generated reference index pages, settings docs, home docs, chat docs,
  integration docs, troubleshooting docs, and skill/plugin/MCP docs.
- **Docs CI workflow** - adds a GitHub Actions docs workflow and automated
  validation tests so generated docs, metadata, and screenshot references can
  be checked before publishing.

### UI, Status & Runtime Polish

- **Agent-aware Row-Bot Status** - expands Row-Bot Status output to include
  agent/profile/run and media-provider reporting used by diagnostics and
  delegated work.
- **Streaming and render updates** - updates streaming, render, transcript,
  tool-trace, and chat component paths so profile context, child-agent
  activity, tool traces, and long-running status updates remain visible.
- **Command Center polish** - reorganizes activity and goal status grouping so
  active goals, child agents, and related runtime events are easier to scan.
- **Home and setup capture stability** - adjusts Home, onboarding center, setup
  wizard, and settings surfaces used by both users and the real UI docs capture
  pipeline.
- **Tunnel and channel coverage** - updates tunnel behavior and channel runtime
  tests to cover the new agent/goal execution paths without weakening existing
  channel safety behavior.
- **Installer source-layout note** - refreshes the Windows installer source
  coverage comment to include the stability module in the packaged recursive
  source include.

### Tests & Release Validation

- **Agent and Goal coverage** - adds focused tests for active-run queues,
  approvals, agent commands, agent context, profiles, runtime profiles,
  runners, durable runs, tool allowlists, write locks, UI contracts, Goal Mode,
  channel goal runtime, and Row-Bot Status agent reporting.
- **xAI OAuth coverage** - adds provider and transport tests for OAuth token
  state, refresh behavior, provider status, model catalog integration,
  runtime availability, vision probing, model defaults, and setup/settings
  contracts.
- **xAI media coverage** - adds tests for xAI media model discovery, Grok
  Imagine image/video options, media tool routing, Row-Bot Status media output,
  and image-to-video payload behavior.
- **Provider secret coverage** - adds tests for auth-store fallback behavior,
  custom endpoint auth requirements, provider selection, provider catalog rows,
  and headless/no-keyring semantics.
- **Model picker and settings coverage** - expands model picker regression and
  settings-overhaul contract tests around provider-qualified refs, inactive
  choices, unsupported surfaces, and xAI OAuth defaults.
- **Public docs automation coverage** - adds docs automation tests for metadata
  inventory, generated pages, validation, screenshot references, and real UI
  docs generation inputs.
- **UI/runtime coverage** - expands tests for app-port stability, app
  hardening, chat tool trace UI, home performance, onboarding, skill
  activation, thinking retention, tunnel management, and status media paths.

### Breaking Changes And Caveats

- xAI Grok OAuth support is separate from the existing xAI API-key provider.
  API keys still use the `xai` provider path; subscription/OAuth-backed Grok
  runtime uses `xai_oauth` provider-qualified model refs.
- xAI Grok runtime and Grok Imagine media require a successful OAuth connection
  and upstream account/model access. If token health fails, related model rows
  may appear inactive until reconnect or refresh succeeds.
- Grok Imagine media models are intentionally scoped to image and video
  surfaces and should not appear as chat, agent, or vision-only models.
- Agent Profiles and Goal Mode create durable local run/goal records. Profile
  changes, promotions, and other destructive agent-management actions remain
  approval-gated.
- On systems without a secure keyring, newly entered provider secrets are
  session-only and must be re-entered after restart unless a secure keyring
  backend is configured.
- The landing-page changes in this commit range prepared the published v4.1.0
  site. Final v4.2.0 artifact links and the website landing-page refresh remain
  release-gate tasks after the release assets are live.

## v4.1.0 - Providers, Controlled Self-Evolution, Skills & Diagnostics

This release builds on v4.0.1 with a broad provider and runtime reliability
pass. It adds first-class Atlas Cloud support, introduces a Claude Subscription
provider path, lands controlled self-evolution, improves skill activation and
pinning, hardens custom tool creation, and fixes several model-picker,
streaming, voice, vision, setup, and diagnostics regressions that surfaced
after the 4.0.0 rebrand.

### Provider Runtime & Model Catalog

- **Atlas Cloud first-class provider** - adds Atlas Cloud as a native provider
  instead of treating it as a generic custom endpoint, with provider identity,
  setup copy, authentication wiring, runtime routing, and model references that
  behave like the existing first-class providers.
- **Atlas Cloud model catalog fetching** - adds live Atlas model discovery,
  cache integration, provider-qualified model refs, catalog refresh handling,
  and status/readiness checks so Atlas models appear through the same catalog
  path as other providers.
- **Atlas Cloud agent capability classification** - maps Atlas-hosted models
  into chat and agent-ready surfaces using the provider's API metadata plus
  curated fallbacks for known frontier/provider families, including OpenAI,
  Anthropic, Gemini, Qwen, Kimi, GLM, MiniMax, DeepSeek, and similar
  tool-capable chat models.
- **Atlas Cloud vision capability support** - classifies Atlas-hosted
  multimodal chat models as vision-capable where supported, including hosted
  OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, Qwen-VL, Kimi-VL, GLM vision, and related model
  families.
- **Atlas Cloud media-model filtering** - keeps Atlas image-generation and
  video-generation models out of chat, agent, and vision picker surfaces for
  this phase, preventing non-chat media models from leaking into incompatible
  workflows.
- **Atlas Cloud streaming fixes** - scopes the OpenAI-compatible buffered
  tool-call path so Atlas can stream assistant text after tool calls without
  disturbing existing OpenAI-compatible providers.
- **Atlas Claude transport handling** - adds Atlas-specific Claude behavior for
  streaming, tool-call replay, and native tool-history cleanup so
  Anthropic-hosted models behind Atlas can complete agent turns reliably.
- **OpenAI-compatible transport regression coverage** - expands tests around
  streaming, buffered tool output, Claude-shaped tool calls, and
  provider-specific transport behavior to protect OpenRouter and other existing
  compatible endpoints.
- **Provider capability resolution** - strengthens the shared
  capability-resolution path used by catalogs, readiness checks, vision
  routing, and agent eligibility so provider metadata, curated known-good
  families, and cached model data agree more consistently.
- **Provider status and readiness improvements** - updates provider readiness,
  runtime selection, status reporting, catalog cache behavior, and auth-store
  integration to support the new providers without changing the behavior of
  existing ones.

### Claude Subscription Provider

- **Claude Subscription provider support** - adds a first-class provider path
  for Claude Subscription usage, with provider registration, auth-state
  detection, model references, runtime selection, and setup/status surfaces.
- **Claude Subscription messages transport** - adds a dedicated transport for
  Claude Subscription message exchange, including prompt conversion, tool-call
  handling, and response normalization.
- **Claude Subscription auth and diagnostics** - adds provider
  subscription-auth helpers, external credential handling, readiness checks,
  and tests so the app can report whether the subscription runtime is actually
  available.
- **Provider selection integration** - wires Claude Subscription into
  provider/model selection without taking over Anthropic API-key behavior or
  other Claude-compatible provider paths.

### Controlled Self-Evolution

- **Controlled self-evolution engine** - introduces the first controlled
  self-evolution runtime, with structured change proposals, reviewable
  execution boundaries, persistence, and test coverage.
- **Self-reflection skill updates** - adds bundled self-reflection guidance so
  Row-Bot can reason about improvement opportunities through a constrained
  skill flow instead of ad-hoc code changes.
- **Dream-cycle integration** - connects controlled improvement work into the
  existing dream-cycle and memory-policy systems so reflection output can be
  captured and revisited safely.
- **Prompt and agent integration** - updates agent and prompt wiring so
  self-improvement behavior is explicit, bounded, and aligned with the rest of
  the assistant runtime.
- **Command Center visibility** - adds UI/status hooks for evolution state and
  related activity so controlled self-evolution is observable instead of hidden
  background behavior.

### Skills, Developer Tools & Custom Tool Builder

- **Skill pinning defaults** - adds default pinning behavior and activation
  tests so important skills can remain discoverable and stable across sessions.
- **Skill activation reliability** - improves the skill activation path and
  channel command handling, with coverage for pinned skills, command routing,
  and activation edge cases.
- **Custom tool builder hardening** - strengthens Git and virtualenv handling
  in the custom tool builder so new tool projects are created more reliably
  across local environments.
- **Developer Studio storage and capsules** - improves developer storage, tool
  capsule handling, and Developer Studio UI behavior used by the custom tool
  flow.
- **Tool-builder guidance updates** - refreshes the custom tool builder guide
  to reflect the safer Git/venv workflow and the current implementation.

### Chat, Voice & Model Picker Reliability

- **Anthropic thinking-block normalization** - fixes normalization of
  Anthropic thinking blocks so reasoning content does not corrupt downstream
  transcript handling.
- **Local voice talk submission fix** - repairs local voice talk submission so
  voice input can be sent through the normal chat path again.
- **Ollama vision cache handling** - fixes Ollama vision model detection to
  respect cached capability data instead of losing vision support after catalog
  refreshes.
- **Migration wizard repair** - fixes migration wizard UI and Ollama status
  behavior so setup and upgrade flows do not report misleading provider state.
- **Model-picker regression coverage** - adds tests around chat-only, vision,
  provider readiness, and model-picker behavior to prevent capability labels
  from drifting again.
- **Streaming batcher coverage** - expands streaming tests around batched output
  so incremental rendering remains responsive after provider and tool-call
  changes.
- **Chat keybinding coverage** - adds chat keybinding tests to protect composer
  behavior while provider and streaming internals continue to evolve.

### Insights, Status & Diagnostics

- **Insights status tray diagnostics** - fixes the insights status tray
  diagnostic path so provider and runtime issues are surfaced with more useful
  state.
- **macOS tray reliability** - restores the packaged macOS launcher to the
  pystray green/grey status dots after the native menu-bar icon path proved
  unreliable on test installs.
- **Row-Bot status tool updates** - refreshes the Row-Bot status tool and
  guide, including provider/media reporting paths used during diagnostics.
- **Provider settings and status UI** - updates provider settings, status
  checks, status bar, setup wizard, and related UI state for the new
  provider/runtime readiness model.
- **Home and performance stability** - improves home-screen performance
  behavior and adds UI performance coverage for the post-rebrand shell.
- **Application stability tests** - adds broader app-stability hardening tests
  around setup, settings, provider state, streaming, and catalog interactions.

### Documentation, Website & Architecture

- **Architecture docs refresh** - updates the architecture documentation and
  diagrams to match the Row-Bot rebrand and current runtime/provider structure.
- **Website download links** - updates the docs site download links for the
  v4.0.1 package line.
- **Runtime and provider documentation alignment** - updates README and docs
  surfaces touched by provider setup, installer guidance, and architecture
  diagrams.

### Tests & Release Validation

- **Atlas Cloud coverage** - adds first-class Atlas tests for model catalog
  fetching, capability classification, auth/setup behavior, OpenAI-compatible
  transport behavior, streaming, tool calls, and vision refs.
- **Claude Subscription coverage** - adds Claude Subscription auth, transport,
  provider runtime, and subscription-readiness tests.
- **Controlled self-evolution coverage** - adds controlled self-evolution tests
  around proposal handling, persistence, guardrails, and integration points.
- **Skill and command coverage** - adds tests for skill pinning, skill
  activation, channel skill commands, and custom tool builder flows.
- **Provider runtime coverage** - expands provider catalog, runtime, selection,
  readiness, auth-store, API-key storage, and subscription-auth tests.
- **UI and workflow coverage** - expands tests for migration wizard behavior,
  insights provider status, status media, chat keybindings, streaming batching,
  home performance, and settings/provider contracts.

### Breaking Changes And Caveats

- Atlas Cloud requires an Atlas Cloud API key and a successful catalog refresh
  before its live model list can be used.
- Atlas Cloud image-generation and video-generation models are intentionally
  hidden from chat, agent, and vision surfaces in this phase.
- Atlas capability labels depend on provider metadata plus curated known-good
  model families; newly released Atlas models may need a catalog refresh or
  future classification update before they appear with the most specific
  capability label.
- Claude Subscription support depends on the local subscription auth/runtime
  path being available and should not be confused with the Anthropic API-key
  provider.
- Controlled self-evolution is deliberately constrained to reviewable, bounded
  flows; it is not an unrestricted autonomous code modification mode.
- Custom tool builder reliability still depends on a working local Git and
  Python virtualenv environment.

## v4.0.1 - Ollama Model Picker Hotfix

This patch fixes a Settings -> Models regression in v4.0.0 where local Ollama
model selections could fail when Row-Bot saved a provider-qualified family ref
such as `model:ollama:llama3` but the Ollama daemon exposed the installed model
as a tagged runtime name such as `llama3:latest`.

- **Ollama model switching** - local Ollama family aliases now resolve to the
  installed daemon tag when there is one unambiguous match, while explicit tags
  and ambiguous families remain unchanged.
- **Provider runtime coverage** - the same alias resolution now applies through
  both the legacy model helpers and the provider runtime constructor used by
  chat-only/provider-backed local model paths.
- **Regression tests** - added focused coverage for unique and ambiguous Ollama
  family aliases, context lookup, provider-qualified picker values, and provider
  runtime construction.

Fixes #178. Thanks to @lihouwenbin for the original PR and investigation.

## v4.0.0 - Row-Bot Rebrand, Skills Hub, Voice, Providers & Installer Reliability

This is the public Row-Bot rebrand release. It moves the app from Thoth to
Row-Bot across product identity, repository metadata, installers, runtime paths,
release artifacts, documentation, launcher behavior, updater contracts, and
user-data locations. Existing 3.x data is preserved through a copy-first
migration path, so users can upgrade without losing rollback access to their old
Thoth data. Beyond the rebrand, v4.0.0 ships major upgrades to Smart Skills,
Skills Hub, realtime voice, provider discovery, approval modes, thread
organization, packaging, startup reliability, and release validation.

### Row-Bot Rebrand

- **Product identity** - app copy, bundled skills, tool guides, docs, release
  workflows, installer scripts, updater metadata, icons, and public repository
  links now use Row-Bot naming.
- **Repository rename support** - canonical public repository references now
  target `github.com/siddsachar/row-bot`.
- **Website contract** - public site configuration now supports `row-bot.ai`
  and the Row-Bot repository identity.
- **Brand assets** - adds Row-Bot glyphs, favicon, installer icon, docs imagery,
  runtime brand helpers, and brand-constant tests.
- **Release asset names** - v4 artifacts use `Row-Bot-X.Y.Z-Windows-x64.exe`,
  `Row-Bot-X.Y.Z-macOS-{arm64|x86_64}.dmg`, and
  `Row-Bot-X.Y.Z-Linux-ARCH.tar.gz`.
- **Linux command rename** - Linux installs expose `row-bot` as the user command
  and use the Row-Bot XDG data tree.
- **macOS app rename** - macOS packaging now builds `Row-Bot.app` instead of the
  legacy Thoth app bundle.
- **Windows launcher rename** - Windows launcher scripts, installer scripts, and
  shortcut entry points now use Row-Bot names.
- **Documentation refresh** - README, release docs, architecture docs, installer
  docs, issue templates, contributing docs, and release workflows now reflect
  the Row-Bot identity.

### Migration From Thoth 3.x

- **Copy-first migration** - Row-Bot reads legacy Thoth data, copies it into the
  new Row-Bot locations, and leaves the old data intact for rollback or manual
  recovery.
- **One-shot migration guard** - migration records completion state so normal
  launches do not repeatedly repair already-migrated data.
- **Legacy data coverage** - provider settings, channels, skills, MCP servers,
  plugins, Buddy assets, Designer workspaces, conversations, memories, tasks,
  media, updater state, and runtime config are covered by migration logic.
- **Plugin manifest repair** - legacy plugin manifests are repaired during
  migration so old minimum-version metadata does not block migrated plugins.
- **Post-migration notice** - adds UI and tests for showing users that migration
  completed and where their legacy data remains.
- **Compatibility fixtures** - migration tests cover copied data, guarded
  reruns, plugin metadata repair, runtime data paths, and Row-Bot brand/runtime
  assets.
- **Manual recovery path** - interrupted migrations can be retried after backing
  up both old and new data directories.

### Source Layout & Runtime Packaging

- **Package source layout** - runtime code now lives under `src/row_bot`, with
  compatibility cleanup for the old root-level layout.
- **Version module relocation** - version metadata now lives under the Row-Bot
  package and release scripts read it from the source-layout path.
- **Payload manifest** - adds app payload manifest generation and packaging
  compatibility checks.
- **Source layout docs** - adds `docs/SOURCE_LAYOUT.md` to document the package
  layout and compatibility expectations.
- **Smoke script updates** - app smoke and release helper scripts now understand
  the source-layout package.
- **Import compatibility coverage** - tests cover runtime imports, package
  metadata, installer payloads, and compatibility shims.

### Provider Runtime & Model Discovery

- **OpenCode providers** - adds first-class OpenCode provider support with
  runtime, selection, auth, catalog, and regression coverage.
- **MiniMax live discovery** - MiniMax models are discovered from the provider
  API instead of requiring hard-coded updates for every new model.
- **MiniMax capability mapping** - discovered MiniMax models are mapped into the
  model catalog with provider capabilities where available.
- **MiniMax stale cleanup** - stale MiniMax models can be removed automatically
  when they are no longer returned by the provider API.
- **Custom endpoint cleanup** - stale custom endpoint model references are
  cleaned up so old provider selections do not linger incorrectly.
- **Custom reasoning fixes** - custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints handle
  reasoning fields more reliably.
- **Custom vision fixes** - custom endpoint vision references and capability
  handling are repaired.
- **OpenAI-compatible transport coverage** - tests expand coverage around custom
  endpoint request shaping, provider refs, model catalog behavior, and
  live-provider discovery.
- **Provider settings updates** - provider UI and runtime settings now better
  reflect Row-Bot naming and newer provider catalog behavior.

### Chat, Attachments & Channels

- **Chat attachment bridge** - fixes the filesystem bridge used by chat
  attachments so local file references survive the intended handoff path.
- **Custom provider channel routing** - channel workflows now route
  custom-provider turns through the correct provider/runtime path.
- **Channel command support** - channel command handling moves into the Row-Bot
  package layout and gains focused coverage.
- **Workflow delivery defaults** - workflow/channel routing preserves approval
  and provider context across resumed turns.
- **Runtime status updates** - Row-Bot status tools and channel/runtime
  diagnostics now report Row-Bot naming and effective runtime state more
  consistently.

### Smart Skills & Skills Hub

- **Smart Skills activation** - adds skill activation logic for suggesting,
  enabling, disabling, and applying manual skills in chat context.
- **Slash command support** - adds slash-command infrastructure and tests for
  skill-aware chat commands.
- **Command palette skills** - command palette integration can surface skills and
  skill actions more directly.
- **Composer skill parity** - Designer and Developer chat composers gain access
  to shared skill and slash-command behavior.
- **Skills Hub marketplace** - adds a Skills Hub for browsing, detecting,
  importing, searching, and installing skills from supported sources.
- **Marketplace sources** - adds source adapters for GitHub, pasted Markdown, URL
  inputs, well-known skill indexes, and marketplace-style catalogs.
- **Import detection** - pasted or linked skill content can be detected and
  normalized before installation.
- **Search index** - Skills Hub includes local search/index helpers for browsing
  available skills.
- **Bundled skill updates** - bundled skills and tool guides are updated for
  Row-Bot naming and newer runtime behavior.
- **Skills tests** - adds broad tests for skills activation, Skills Hub sources,
  import detection, search, UI contracts, and slash commands.

### Realtime Voice

- **Realtime voice overhaul** - adds a new realtime voice runtime with provider
  interfaces, coordinator, client contracts, presenter state, and lifecycle
  helpers.
- **OpenAI realtime support** - adds OpenAI realtime provider/client pieces and
  tests.
- **Voice actions** - adds structured voice action handling so realtime voice can
  interact with Row-Bot behavior more safely.
- **Agent bridge** - realtime voice can bridge into agent/runtime behavior
  through a dedicated layer.
- **Cue policy** - adds conversational cue policy, speech policy, output
  coordination, and realtime event handling.
- **Local voice provider support** - adds local provider scaffolding for voice
  runtime selection.
- **Browser dispatch coverage** - tests cover realtime browser dispatch and
  voice event surfaces.
- **Voice UI lifecycle** - adds UI helpers for voice lifecycle and realtime event
  presentation.

### Approval Modes, Threads & Developer UX

- **Unified approval modes** - approval behavior is consolidated so chat,
  Developer, tools, and workflows can use clearer shared approval semantics.
- **Approval gate tooling** - adds approval-gate helpers for tool execution.
- **Thread rename** - conversations can be renamed and thread rename behavior is
  covered by tests.
- **Thread actions** - adds shared thread-action helpers and tests.
- **Developer grouping** - Developer/code threads are grouped and restored more
  cleanly from the sidebar.
- **Developer workspace state** - Developer UI, storage, thread context, and
  workspace contracts are updated for the new package layout and grouping
  behavior.
- **Sidebar refinements** - sidebar filtering and Developer grouping behavior are
  covered by focused tests.
- **Buddy avatar behavior** - default assistant avatar handling now respects
  selected Buddy identity more consistently.

### Windows Launch, Update & Startup Reliability

- **Launcher diagnostics** - launcher events now write timing and failure details
  to `launcher.log`.
- **Splash hardening** - Tk splash failures are logged, and visible Windows
  console splash fallback is opt-in instead of appearing unexpectedly.
- **Window picker hardening** - first-run picker behavior is hardened to avoid
  blank-console launch paths.
- **Packaged Windows Tk validation** - installer build logic now validates
  bundled Tk support in embedded Python.
- **Native dependency bundling** - Windows Tk smoke checks account for required
  native DLLs, explicit DLL directories, and bundled `zlib`.
- **Ollama startup gating** - batch-level Ollama auto-start is gated behind an
  explicit environment variable.
- **Update handoff helper** - Windows updates now use a detached handoff helper
  so Row-Bot can quit before the installer replaces files.
- **Startup hardening tests** - launcher, splash, update handoff, and startup
  hardening tests are expanded.
- **Packaged launch validation** - Windows installer fixes were verified through
  test-machine install and launch flows.

### Installers, Builds & Release Automation

- **Windows installer rename** - Inno Setup scripts now build Row-Bot branded
  Windows artifacts.
- **Windows embedded runtime fixes** - embedded Python packaging now copies and
  validates required native pieces for Tk and startup smoke checks.
- **macOS packaging fixes** - macOS build scripts understand Row-Bot app naming,
  source layout, and package payload paths.
- **Linux packaging fixes** - Linux build scripts create required package payload
  parent directories and install into the Row-Bot command/data layout.
- **Release workflow updates** - GitHub Actions release workflow now reads
  version metadata from the package layout and builds Row-Bot artifacts.
- **Notarization workflow updates** - notarization submit/check workflows are
  updated for Row-Bot artifact names.
- **Manifest updates** - release manifest helpers and SHA manifest scripts are
  updated for the new artifact contract.
- **Installer docs** - installer README and release docs now document Row-Bot
  artifact names and install behavior.
- **Public site bridge** - public download links temporarily point at the
  published `v3.23.1` Thoth artifacts until v4 artifacts are published.

### Tests & Release Validation

- **Full rebrand audit** - tracked references were audited so remaining legacy
  names are limited to historical release notes, deferred public website
  handoff, and intentional migration compatibility.
- **Compile validation** - source, scripts, and tests were compile-checked after
  rebrand/source-layout work.
- **Full pytest pass** - full test suite passed for release validation, with only
  known warnings/skips and one non-fatal Windows notification thread
  exception after summary.
- **App smoke pass** - `scripts/smoke_app.py` passed against the Row-Bot package
  layout.
- **Focused regression suites** - provider, skills, migration, startup,
  packaging, voice, channel routing, and source-layout tests were added or
  expanded.
- **Live provider validation** - MiniMax live discovery was tested through
  Row-Bot's actual provider system against the real API.
- **Installer validation** - Windows, Linux, and macOS installer build issues
  found during prerelease testing were fixed before final release readiness.
### Breaking Changes And Caveats

- **Manual major-version upgrade** - existing 3.x users should manually install
  Row-Bot v4 for the major rebrand jump. Pre-v4 updater clients expect the old
  Thoth artifact and manifest contract.
- **New data locations** - Row-Bot uses new Row-Bot data paths. Legacy Thoth data
  is copied, not moved.
- **Legacy plugin metadata** - plugins should declare `min_row_bot_version`.
  Legacy plugin manifests are repaired where possible during migration.
- **Artifact names changed** - release assets now use Row-Bot names. Do not
  publish duplicate legacy-named v4 artifacts.
- **Provider discovery depends on APIs** - live model discovery can only reflect
  what providers return through their current APIs.
- **First launch may migrate data** - first v4 launch over a 3.x install can take
  longer while Row-Bot copies and repairs legacy data.

## v3.23.1 - Custom Endpoint Tool-Calling Hotfix

This hotfix repairs custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint tool calling for local servers such as LM Studio. Streamed tool-call fragments are now assembled before execution, malformed empty-name fragments are dropped, custom endpoint tool turns fall back to non-stream unless streamed tool calling has been explicitly probed, and endpoint status labels now distinguish local custom endpoints from Ollama.

## v3.23.0 — Provider Runtime, Memory Recall & UI Performance Hardening

This release hardens the runtime paths that were expanded in v3.22.0. The headline work is **provider compatibility**: Thoth now preserves provider-qualified model identity end to end, routes incompatible models into a safer chat-only path, probes custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints before trusting tool support, and normalizes tricky provider transcripts before replay. It also ships a major **memory recall uplift**, with deterministic bounded recall, lexical and graph-expanded candidates, audit metadata, review states, and provenance surfaces. Around that, v3.23.0 makes large transcripts and Settings screens lighter, adds task database recovery, improves local/self-hosted setup, and expands regression coverage around real provider behavior.

### Provider Runtime & Custom Endpoints

- **Provider-qualified model identity** — model choices now keep their provider identity across Settings, catalog pinning, defaults, thread overrides, status displays, setup wizard choices, and runtime construction.
- **No accidental OpenRouter fallback** — unknown bare model IDs no longer silently route to OpenRouter when the original provider cannot be inferred.
- **Runtime readiness routing** — provider/runtime checks now distinguish full agent mode, chat-only mode, and blocked configurations before a broken run starts.
- **Context-window guardrails** — small context windows block agent mode with clearer guidance, while medium windows can use chat-only mode when tool schemas would not fit reliably.
- **Unified context policy** — local, cloud, and custom endpoint context caps now flow through one policy path with model maximums, user caps, and request-time context parameters where supported.
- **Context cache invalidation** — changing local or cloud context settings clears stale LLM clients so subsequent turns use the new limits.
- **Custom endpoint profiles** — OpenAI-compatible endpoints can use profile behavior for common local and proxy servers such as LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp, LocalAI, LiteLLM, SGLang, oMLX-style servers, and generic OpenAI-compatible backends.
- **Custom endpoint probing** — self-hosted endpoints can be probed for catalog availability, streaming support, tool-call behavior, and model compatibility, with probe results persisted for later readiness decisions.
- **Native metadata discovery** — LM Studio and llama.cpp metadata paths are used when available to discover context windows and native tool support more accurately.
- **No-auth endpoint support** — local endpoints that do not require API keys can refresh catalogs without unnecessary secret lookups.
- **OpenAI-compatible transport** — adds a dedicated transport for custom OpenAI-compatible chat, streaming, tool serialization, tool-call chunks, reasoning fields, runtime context overrides, and clearer HTTP error messages.
- **Unsupported payload cleanup** — custom endpoint profiles can drop unsupported parameters such as tools, tool choice, parallel tool calls, reasoning, response formats, or tool history when a backend cannot accept them.
- **Tool-call recovery** — local models that emit tool-call envelopes as text or reasoning can be recovered into structured tool calls when safe.
- **Reasoning-only response handling** — reasoning-only outputs after successful tool calls can be promoted into final visible content, while reasoning-only failures after tool errors produce actionable errors instead of silent empty replies.
- **Custom tool validation repair** — local/custom providers can receive a repair message when a tool call misses required fields such as `query`, reducing dead-end schema failures.
- **Ollama tool probing** — unknown or uncertain local Ollama models can be promoted to agent mode only after a real tool round-trip succeeds.
- **Ollama launch cleanup** — the launcher now starts Ollama only when saved Brain or Vision settings actually need local Ollama, and `--no-ollama` forces the skip.
- **Ollama reasoning behavior** — Ollama reasoning is enabled only for detected reasoning models instead of being forced globally.
- **Vision provider refs** — local Vision calls strip provider-qualified Ollama refs at the runtime edge while provider/cloud refs still route through the correct path.
- **Designer runtime readiness** — Designer text refinement and speaker-note generation now use the active model override and verify that the selected model is agent-ready.

### Chat-Only Runtime & Transcript Compatibility

- **Chat-only runtime path** — non-tool or tool-incompatible models can answer normal chat without building the full tool graph.
- **Compact chat-only prompt** — chat-only mode uses a smaller prompt that avoids implying tools, workflows, or task actions are available.
- **Tool-free history shaping** — prior tool turns are summarized for chat-only context without replaying full tool bodies or invalid protocol shapes.
- **Chat-only streaming persistence** — chat-only responses stream and persist through the normal conversation paths.
- **Runtime surface tagging** — chat, channels, workflow approvals, Designer, and forced agent surfaces now tag their runtime mode so provider readiness can make the right routing decision.
- **Provider transcript diagnostics** — model-facing transcripts are inspected for invalid tool calls, duplicate tool IDs, orphan tool results, and reasoning-field hazards.
- **Transcript normalization** — provider-facing messages drop no-op assistant turns, strip invalid tool calls, rewrite duplicate tool-call IDs, drop orphan tool results, and remove unsafe reasoning fields for custom-tool artifacts.
- **Thinking retention** — non-empty thinking/reasoning text is preserved through streaming, reattach, persisted transcript rendering, and final message display.
- **Reasoning-only final guard** — reasoning-only chunks are no longer mistaken for final assistant content when there is no visible answer.
- **Checkpoint transcript loading** — transcript loading can read checkpoint messages and token usage without importing or constructing the agent graph.
- **Legacy checkpoint repair** — checkpoint version values are normalized when older integer versions are encountered.
- **Detached stream finalization** — detached clients can finalize with scoped transcript refreshes instead of rebuilding the full main UI.
- **Optimistic message preservation** — user messages remain visible during detached finalize and reconnect flows.

### Memory Recall & Knowledge Audit

- **Bounded auto-recall policy** — Agent turns now use deterministic memory recall with query building, context-aware token budgeting, scoring, filtering, and trace output.
- **Hybrid recall candidates** — recall combines semantic search, FTS5 lexical search, keyword fallback, and graph-neighbor expansion.
- **Graph-expanded recall** — strong seed memories can pull in related graph nodes with relation confidence and hop metadata.
- **Recall-safe candidate retrieval** — candidate inspection no longer mutates recall timestamps until the final selected memories are injected.
- **Recall reinforcement** — selected memories are touched with `recalled_at` and recall-count metadata after they are actually used.
- **Memory tier scoring** — recall ranks core, semantic, episodic, and resource memories differently based on source, confidence, evidence, recency, and query fit.
- **Status-aware filtering** — archived, needs-review, superseded, stale, weak, greeting-only, runtime-status, and unanchored resource memories are filtered out of normal auto-recall.
- **Recall traces** — recent recall decisions are written to a compact trace file for debugging why memories were included or rejected.
- **FTS5 memory index** — knowledge graph entities now maintain a lexical search index for faster exact/keyword recall.
- **Memory evolution helpers** — new integrity helpers normalize status, tier, confidence, evidence, source context, manual edits, review state, superseding, archival, and journal entries.
- **Memory review states** — memories can now be active, needs review, superseded, or archived without losing the underlying entity.
- **Audit metadata** — extracted, document-derived, wiki-synced, and manually edited memories preserve stronger provenance, confidence, evidence, and source context.
- **Conflict handling** — extraction can mark conflicting memories for review instead of overwriting high-authority user facts.
- **Low-confidence relation filtering** — background extraction skips weak inferred relations instead of adding noisy graph edges.
- **Extraction journal** — memory extraction records run summaries, per-thread details, skipped relations, and extraction outcomes.
- **Resource hub memories** — document extraction creates or updates resource-style hub memories with provenance and audit fields.
- **Wiki sync provenance** — wiki vault sync preserves audit/status metadata and appends memory-evolution journal entries.
- **Knowledge audit UI** — Settings and entity editor surfaces now expose audit badges, filters, review queues, recall traces, and evolution journal entries.
- **Entity review actions** — individual memories/entities can be archived, marked for review, superseded, restored to active, or marked as user-modified from the editor.
- **Memory tool output** — memory search/list/save/update output now includes IDs, status, confidence, tier, and recall-aware results so agents can modify the right memory.

### UI Performance & Transcript Loading

- **UI performance utilities** — adds generation tokens, timed UI sections, slow-section logging, and safe UI callback/task wrappers.
- **Bounded transcript windows** — large conversations render a bounded visible window with an explicit load-earlier path instead of rebuilding every message at once.
- **Async model picker cache** — model picker options are cached and refreshed asynchronously so chat inputs can appear quickly.
- **Model surface placeholders** — chat can render lightweight model/provider placeholders while detailed model status resolves in the background.
- **Generation-safe token counters** — token counter updates are debounced and ignored when they belong to an older render generation.
- **Lazy Home panels** — Home tab panels defer heavier Developer, Designer, Knowledge, and Activity work until opened.
- **Coalesced status refreshes** — Home status pill refreshes are cached and coalesced to reduce repeated expensive checks.
- **Settings generation guards** — Settings tab renders use generation tokens and local error boundaries so stale async work cannot overwrite newer UI.
- **Deferred Settings tabs** — heavier Settings tab content is scheduled lazily instead of blocking the shell.
- **Lazy Knowledge sections** — memory browsing, audit details, relationship loading, recall traces, and journal rows load on demand.
- **Off-UI-loop entity saves** — entity editor saves run off the UI loop and refresh Knowledge state in staged steps.
- **Render instrumentation** — graph chat, streaming, Mermaid rendering, text embeds, transcript rendering, and blank-thread startup now include performance instrumentation.
- **Performance harness** — adds a local harness for profiling real transcripts and blank-thread shells.

### Task Database Recovery

- **Shared data path helpers** — local database paths now resolve through a shared data-path module for tasks, memory, threads, and diagnostics.
- **Task schema validation** — startup/task operations validate required tables and columns before use.
- **In-place schema repair** — partial task databases can be repaired in place while preserving existing rows when possible.
- **Corrupt DB recovery** — corrupt task databases are backed up and recreated with a clean schema.
- **Schema retry wrappers** — task operations retry once after repairing schema-related SQLite errors.
- **Malformed migration tolerance** — workflow-to-task migration skips malformed legacy rows after the destination schema exists.
- **Launcher recovery commands** — `launcher.py --reset-tasks-db`, `--reset-db`, and `--restore-data` can back up and recreate local SQLite stores.
- **WAL/SHM backup coverage** — task, memory, and thread DB backup/restore handles SQLite companion files.
- **Support diagnostics** — Home, Command Center, and `thoth_status` show task-schema state, recovery guidance, last repair, and schema errors.

### Tools, Channels & Runtime Reliability

- **Channel runtime routing** — Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, and SMS now mark channel turns as channel/auto runtime, while approval resumes force agent mode.
- **Approval resume routing** — channel approval resumes explicitly request agent mode so tool continuations do not fall into chat-only routing.
- **Wikipedia HTTPS endpoint** — the Wikipedia tool forces the legacy client onto the HTTPS API endpoint.
- **Wikipedia recoverable errors** — upstream JSON/API failures now return a recoverable tool result that tells the agent not to retry the same query blindly.
- **Wikipedia usage guidance** — the tool description now steers broad conceptual questions away from unnecessary encyclopedia lookups.
- **Thoth Status model reporting** — status output reports the effective runtime model/mode more accurately.
- **Thoth Status task reporting** — scheduled-task status now includes schema diagnostics before listing configured tasks.
- **Command Center recovery copy** — task-schema failures point users toward the new launcher recovery command.

### Tests & Release Checks

- **Provider readiness coverage** — tests cover agent/chat-only/block routing, context floors, cached capability snapshots, OpenRouter metadata, Ollama probing, and custom endpoint probing.
- **Custom provider coverage** — tests cover profiles, no-auth endpoints, native metadata discovery, streaming probes, context overrides, and setup wizard payloads.
- **OpenAI-compatible transport coverage** — tests cover request payloads, tool calls, streaming, reasoning-only finals, unsupported parameters, and provider error handling.
- **Provider selection coverage** — tests cover provider-qualified refs, duplicate model IDs across providers, Ollama refs, Quick Choices, and stale capability refresh.
- **Chat-only and transcript coverage** — tests cover chat-only streaming, forced agent surfaces, checkpoint transcript loading, checkpoint version repair, detached finalize, and thinking retention.
- **Memory recall coverage** — tests cover auto-recall scoring, filtering, graph expansion, recall traces, evolution helpers, audit helpers, and memory extraction metadata.
- **UI performance coverage** — tests cover generation tokens, safe UI callbacks, bounded transcript windows, lazy Knowledge surfaces, staged refreshes, and performance harness wiring.
- **Task recovery coverage** — tests cover empty data dirs, partial schemas, corrupt DB recreation, migration tolerance, launcher reset/restore args, and DB-family backup.
- **Tool/runtime regressions** — tests cover Wikipedia recovery, Vision provider refs, Designer routing, Home performance, model picker regressions, and opt-in live provider matrix behavior.
- **Live provider marker** — adds a `live_provider` pytest marker for real configured-provider calls that remain opt-in.

### Release Notes & Risk Notes

- **Custom endpoint compatibility depends on the server** — profiles and probes improve behavior for common OpenAI-compatible servers, but local/proxy backends can still vary in tool syntax, streaming behavior, and context parameter names.
- **Chat-only mode is intentionally limited** — models routed to chat-only mode can answer normal conversation but should not be expected to run tools, workflows, or structured agent actions.
- **Memory recall is more selective** — archived, superseded, weak, or unanchored memories may stop appearing automatically; users can still review and restore memory state from Knowledge surfaces.
- **Task DB recovery backs up before reset** — recovery commands preserve old SQLite files under the local recovery directory, but reset flows can remove active scheduled-task rows from the live DB until restored.
- **Live provider tests are opt-in** — the new live matrix is useful for release validation with configured credentials, but it is not part of the normal offline unit suite.

## v3.22.0 — Developer Studio, Custom Tools, Workflow Delivery & Stability Overhaul

This release turns Thoth into a broader **workbench for chat, workflows, code, documents, and user-built tools**. The headline feature is **Developer Studio**: a Codex-style coding workspace for connecting local Git repositories, reviewing code, planning and applying changes, running tests, preparing PRs, and working inside an optional Docker shadow sandbox. It also adds **Custom Tools**, letting users turn GitHub repos or local folders into reusable Thoth tools through a guided or conversational flow. Around that, v3.22.0 substantially improves workflow delivery defaults, Home status visibility, Settings organization, onboarding, model catalog performance, embedding provider choice, chat tool traces, and app stability diagnostics.

### Developer Studio

- **Developer workspace surface** — adds a new Developer home tab for code workspaces, recent repos, explicit local-folder linking, explicit clone destinations, and code-thread restoration from the sidebar.
- **Code threads** — Developer conversations are marked as code threads, reopen directly into Developer Studio, keep workspace context, and preserve code-specific state separately from normal chat and Designer threads.
- **Repository context injection** — Developer turns receive compact, authoritative workspace context including repo path, branch, dirty state, remote URL, top-level files, approval mode, execution mode, and shell guidance, without showing that context in the user message.
- **Codex-style approval modes** — Developer Studio supports coding approval modes such as read-only, ask before changes, auto edit, and agent run. The mode is changeable at any time and reflected in the Developer Inspector safety policy.
- **Developer-native tools** — adds workspace-scoped tools for repo info, file listing, file reads, search, git status, branch create/switch, commit, push, fast-forward merge, diffs, todos, detected test commands, shell commands, patch preview/apply, file writes, sandbox imports, and agent-owned change reverts.
- **Developer skills and tool guides** — adds Developer-focused bundled skills for coding, review, PR prep, and Custom Tools, plus a concise Developer tool guide. These are wired for Developer context instead of bloating normal chat by default.
- **Developer todo planning** — adds persistent visible todos for coding threads, with status updates surfaced in the inspector so long coding jobs can keep a checkpointed plan.
- **Developer Inspector** — adds a right-side Developer Inspector with Overview, Safety Policy, Sandbox, Todos, Changes, Files, Agent Changes, Tests, and GitHub/PR sections.
- **Live inspector snapshots** — the inspector refreshes from debounced background snapshots instead of full UI rebuilds, preserving expanded sections and reducing disconnect/crash risk during long runs.
- **Resizable inspector** — the Developer Inspector can be widened for diffs, files, and test output without crowding the main chat.
- **File tree view** — the Files section renders a tree-style repo view instead of a flat label list, making larger repos easier to scan.
- **Diff and change review** — changed files show added/removed line counts, per-file diffs, and agent-owned change sets.
- **Safe revert support** — agent-owned edits are recorded and can be reverted when files have not drifted.
- **GitHub CLI integration** — Developer Studio detects `gh` from common Windows install paths and gates PR/push operations through Developer approval policy.
- **Long coding turn budget** — Developer Studio now gets its own recursion/step budget, separate from normal chat and workflows, with Developer-specific wind-down prompts that checkpoint progress instead of failing with a generic tool-loop message.

### Docker Sandbox

- **Optional Docker execution mode** — Developer workspaces can run commands in a Docker shadow copy instead of the real repo folder.
- **Persistent sandbox container** — Docker Sandbox uses a persistent per-workspace container and shadow workspace, so repeated commands share the same sandbox state until cleaned or rebuilt.
- **Import-gated edits** — changes made in Docker Sandbox are recorded as pending patches and only affect the real repo after explicit import.
- **Network policy** — Docker Sandbox can run with network off, ask, or on. Network commands and package installs are blocked early when network is off.
- **Sandbox image selection** — users can choose the Docker image for a workspace; changing it cleans the current sandbox copy before the next Docker command.
- **Sandbox process controls** — long-running sandbox processes can be started and stopped through Developer tooling.
- **Clear Docker startup errors** — stopped Docker Desktop, missing images, and credential-helper failures now produce actionable messages instead of raw pipe/file-not-found errors.
- **Local fallback remains available** — users who do not want Docker can keep using local execution with the existing Developer approval policy.

### Custom Tools

- **Custom Tools product surface** — Developer home now includes a Custom Tools area separate from code workspaces, with cards for created tools, commands, test output, enablement, promotion, and removal.
- **Guided Custom Tool wizard** — adds a Source -> Inspect -> Test -> Enable flow for turning a repo URL, local folder, or current workspace into a reusable Thoth tool.
- **Conversational Custom Tool Builder** — adds one agent-facing `custom_tool_builder` utility so users can ask Thoth to inspect a repo, draft commands, refine them, create the tool, and promote it without manually writing a manifest.
- **LLM-assisted command proposals** — Custom Tool creation can use a lightweight model pass to infer useful read-only commands from a repository, with deterministic fallback when AI analysis is unavailable.
- **Safety validation** — proposed Custom Tool commands are validated for dangerous shell patterns, unreviewed network use, write operations, and missing query placeholders.
- **One-time command tests** — Custom Tools can be tested before enablement; local/read-only commands can run directly, while network or riskier commands route through the normal approval policy.
- **Promotion to normal chat** — tested Custom Tools can be promoted into the plugin/tool surface and optionally made available in normal chat through the Utilities toggle.
- **Plugin integration** — promoted Custom Tools register as synthetic plugin tools, appear in plugin/tool management, and can be disabled or removed safely.
- **Source transparency** — Custom Tool cards show source URL, local install path, version, command count, availability, and enablement state.
- **Terminology cleanup** — user-facing UI uses “Custom Tool” instead of the earlier “capsule” wording.

### Workflow Delivery & Workflow Console

- **Workflow-level delivery defaults** — adds a default delivery channel selector for background workflows so new workflows do not default to every channel.
- **Multi-channel defaults** — default delivery can target multiple configured channels while every workflow still always reports run status to the web app.
- **Per-workflow overrides** — workflows can inherit the global default or keep a specific override; changing the global default updates only workflows tied to default.
- **No extra LLM delivery pass** — delivery defaults reuse existing workflow outputs instead of adding an extra model call.
- **Delivery UI polish** — the workflow delivery control was moved and restyled so it no longer reads as part of the multi-select label.
- **Collapsible workflow console** — the right workflow console can collapse/expand, persists its state, and works in browser and pywebview.
- **Approval attention state** — collapsed workflow console shows an attention state when a workflow approval is waiting.
- **Workflow console compact badges** — collapsed state shows compact badges for running workflows, approvals, and insights while expanded state keeps the normal console layout.
- **Recent and upcoming runs** — workflow console surfaces running, approvals, upcoming scheduled runs, quick launch, and recent runs in a denser layout.
- **Workflow Buddy sync** — Buddy state now clears correctly after workflow approval/denial, timeout, stop, cancel, and successful completion.

### Home Status & Buddy Reliability

- **Expanded Home health bar** — Home status now includes compact icon pills for Ollama, active model, cloud API, tunnel, Gmail OAuth, Calendar OAuth, X OAuth, workflows, knowledge, wiki vault, documents, search, skills, tracker, Buddy, MCP, plugins, network, tools, disk, threads DB, FAISS index, Dream Cycle, TTS, and logging.
- **Accurate document/vector status** — document status pills now use the same indexed-file/vector metadata path as Settings.
- **MCP and plugin visibility** — Home status now covers MCP and plugin health instead of only older core checks.
- **Sleek icon-only pills** — status pills use compact icons with hover tooltips, plus amber/red warning indicators for degraded states.
- **Background progress inside status bar** — document extraction and Buddy generation progress remain inside the Home status area while the icon row stays compact.
- **Buddy state machine cleanup** — Buddy state transitions are more deterministic around workflow approvals, denials, pending states, and workflow endings.
- **Desktop overlay focus behavior** — desktop Buddy more reliably appears when the app is minimized or unfocused and hides when the app returns to focus.

### Chat, Streaming & Tool Traces

- **Shift+Enter newline fix** — Shift+Enter now inserts a newline in chat inputs instead of sending the message, matching normal chat app behavior.
- **Input-level model picker** — the main chat model selector moved into the chat input area to match Designer and reduce top-bar clutter.
- **Cloud/privacy banner refresh** — the banner updates when the model changes from the input picker.
- **Grouped tool calls** — repeated tool calls of the same type are grouped into a single expandable trace instead of flooding the transcript with long repeated lists.
- **Balanced browser traces** — browser automation traces are less screenshot-heavy by default while still preserving final visual context when useful.
- **Live tool-call rendering fixes** — tool-call counts and grouped trace state update during streaming instead of only after a later message or reload.
- **Detached stream recovery** — long streams that detach because the client disconnects now persist media and refresh the transcript without forcing full chat rebuilds.
- **Inline approval backup** — Developer approvals also render inline in the active thread when modal/dialog context is unavailable, reducing hidden approval states.
- **NiceGUI timer hardening** — safe one-shot and polling timer helpers avoid creating UI from deleted slots or disconnected clients.

### Settings & Onboarding

- **Settings information architecture cleanup** — window mode moved from System to Preferences, Dream Cycle moved from Knowledge to Preferences, and tunnel settings moved from Channels to System.
- **Settings polish pass** — remaining settings tabs were updated toward the denser Models/Providers/Buddy style, including Utilities, Search, Tracker, Documents, Voice, Vision, Knowledge, System, and related tabs.
- **Model settings cache path** — Settings can render model selectors from cached catalog data while catalog refresh runs in the background.
- **Single catalog refresh concept** — manual refresh is exposed as one model-catalog action instead of many provider-specific refresh buttons.
- **Provider-first onboarding** — first-run onboarding now starts with model/provider choice before migration and setup checklist steps.
- **Setup Center** — adds a resumable setup center reachable from the sidebar hello button, covering model/provider, migration, memory/docs, workflows, Designer, channels, voice, and related setup.
- **Cleaner onboarding copy** — onboarding removes excessive explanatory text, uses quick setup actions, and routes users to Settings only where deeper configuration is needed.
- **All provider coverage** — first setup includes the current provider family, including ChatGPT / Codex, API-key providers, Ollama/local, custom endpoints, and newer providers.
- **Default workflow templates** — seeds five disabled real-world starter workflows, with three simpler and two advanced examples, so nothing runs on a schedule without user permission.
- **Updated welcome message** — first-run welcome and starter prompts now reflect current Thoth features such as workflows, Designer, Developer, channels, documents, memory, voice, and Custom Tools.

### Models, Providers & Embeddings

- **Provider-qualified model selection** — model choices now preserve provider identity across settings, catalog pinning, defaults, thread overrides, status displays, and runtime construction, preventing local/custom models from silently falling back to OpenRouter.
- **Custom endpoint compatibility profiles** — OpenAI-compatible endpoints now include profile behavior for oMLX, LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp, LocalAI, LiteLLM, SGLang, and generic servers, including message normalization, unsupported tool-parameter dropping, and profile-aware context handling.
- **Context override consistency** — local and provider context caps now apply through one policy path, cap to known model/provider maximums, invalidate stale override clients when changed, and pass request-time context parameters for custom endpoints that support them.
- **Non-tool local model guardrails** — native Ollama agent chat now rejects unsupported non-tool models before a broken run, while non-tool custom OpenAI-compatible profiles flatten tool history and omit tool payloads for better server compatibility.
- **Ollama Cloud support** — adds Ollama Cloud as a provider path with direct cloud API transport and support for Ollama daemon cloud-tagged models.
- **Ollama daemon catalog improvements** — installed local models, cloud-tagged local daemon models, library models, families, vision capability, tool capability, and embedding markers are handled more consistently.
- **Ollama vision support paths** — vision-capable Ollama models can be represented through both daemon and direct cloud paths where metadata supports it.
- **Background model catalog cache** — provider and Ollama catalog rows are refreshed in the background and cached for faster Settings loads.
- **Catalog age and refresh state** — model catalog refresh state, cache age, and warnings are tracked for diagnostics and UI display.
- **Provider refresh log noise cleanup** — noisy but non-fatal provider refresh states are preserved without replacing working defaults.
- **Codex SSE diagnostics** — Codex Responses streaming logs start, first delta, completion, and incomplete-stream states more clearly.
- **Configurable embedding providers** — embeddings can now be configured separately from chat models.
- **Local embedding choices** — adds local embedding provider configuration around Qwen, Nomic, and Mixedbread/MXBAI-style models.
- **Cloud embedding option** — supports optional cloud embedding providers with privacy warning copy in Settings.
- **Embedding metadata** — vector stores record embedding provider/dimension metadata and can detect stale indexes when the embedding config changes.
- **Embedding memory release** — heavyweight document and memory extraction paths release cached embedding resources afterward to reduce memory pressure.
- **Document dependency fixes** — adds missing document/embedding support dependencies needed by Markdown and local embedding flows.
- **YouTube transcript packaging** — packages `youtube-transcript-api` so the YouTube transcript tool works in installed builds, not only on the build machine.

### Stability, Startup & Shutdown

- **Stability monitor module** — adds crash reports, UI callback error reports, client-side error capture, asyncio exception handling, thread/unraisable hooks, memory snapshots, and event-loop lag logging.
- **Settings crash diagnostics** — model settings load, collect, and render phases log timings and memory snapshots so large-provider crashes are easier to diagnose.
- **Startup sequencing** — startup now updates splash/status through cached model catalog loading, workflow scheduler start, MCP startup, plugin load, channel migration/autostart, tunnel startup, and knowledge graph load.
- **Clean shutdown work** — app shutdown now attempts ordered channel, tunnel, MCP, and scheduler cleanup to reduce locked log files and lingering processes.
- **Channel credential migration** — channel credentials are migrated into a channel-specific keyring path while preserving legacy fallback if migration fails.
- **Channel status recovery** — channel auth status reporting distinguishes running channels from empty UI fields and legacy keyring fallback.
- **Ngrok log noise handling** — tunnel info logs were reviewed and kept non-fatal while startup/status copy clarifies tunnel state.
- **Windows installer channel inclusion** — installer regressions now ensure new channel auth files are included.
- **Linux native baseline guard** — Linux package builds scan native libraries for unsupported CPU baselines before release upload.

### Tests & Release Checks

- **Developer Studio coverage** — adds phased Developer Studio tests covering workspace setup, approval policy, Git safety, context injection, UI wiring, todos, diffs, tools, Custom Tools, Docker Sandbox, GitHub/PR helpers, and recursion budget.
- **Workflow delivery coverage** — tests default delivery inheritance, overrides, and web-app delivery guarantees.
- **Channel auth coverage** — tests channel keyring migration, fallback, and packaging inclusion.
- **Chat UI coverage** — tests Shift+Enter behavior, grouped tool traces, browser trace behavior, and streaming refresh contracts.
- **Onboarding coverage** — tests setup wizard/center ordering, provider coverage, and starter workflow seeding.
- **Embedding coverage** — tests embedding config, metadata, stale-index detection, and provider switching.
- **Model catalog coverage** — tests background cache shape, refresh behavior, and Ollama/cloud catalog rows.
- **Settings contract coverage** — tests tab moves, section labels, providers guide placement, tunnel relocation, and cloud banner expectations.
- **Home status coverage** — tests expanded status checks, workflow console collapse state, Buddy state transitions, and status accuracy.
- **Stability coverage** — tests performance/stability diagnostics, safe timer behavior, detached stream refresh, and callback error handling.
- **Packaging coverage** — tests YouTube transcript dependency packaging, channel auth store inclusion, Linux native baseline guard, and Windows installer file coverage.
- **Current validation** — the legacy release smoke suite passes with `1885 passed, 0 failed, 5 warnings` after the Developer recursion-budget merge; targeted Developer sandbox + recursion tests pass (`39 passed`).

### Release Notes & Risk Notes

- **Developer Studio is powerful by design** — coding tools can read, edit, run commands, and use Git inside the selected workspace according to the active approval mode. Users should connect only repositories they intend Thoth to inspect or modify.
- **Docker Sandbox is optional** — local execution remains available. Docker Sandbox requires Docker Desktop or a compatible Docker/Podman runtime, a local sandbox image, and enough disk space for shadow workspaces.
- **Custom Tools can execute repo-provided command logic** — Custom Tools are opt-in, testable, removable, and gated by normal tool enablement, but promoted tools should still be reviewed before broad chat availability.
- **Cloud embeddings send text to the chosen provider** — local embeddings remain available for users who want document/vector indexing to stay local.
- **Model catalog freshness is eventually consistent** — cached model rows make Settings faster and more stable, while manual/background refresh updates provider availability after the cache is built.
- **Workflow delivery changes may alter notification volume** — workflows tied to default delivery now follow the workflow-level default instead of sending everywhere.
- **Landing page has been updated for v3.21.0, not yet for v3.22.0 assets** — release download/version links should be updated after v3.22.0 artifacts are published.

## v3.21.0 — Buddy Companion, Model Picker Polish & Linux Startup Reliability

This release adds Thoth's **Buddy companion foundation**, a local-first animated presence that can live in the app sidebar, move around the workspace, and optionally open as a native desktop overlay. It also tightens Settings -> Models behavior, improves provider and Vision model selection, and hardens packaged startup on Windows and Linux so optional native dependency failures are easier to diagnose and less likely to block launch.

### Buddy Companion Foundation

- **Buddy subsystem** — adds a prompt-generated Buddy architecture with a thread-safe event bus, deterministic behavior brain, persistent config, pack validation, Hatch art/motion generation, canvas playback/effects, one dockable in-app Buddy, and a separate desktop overlay surface.
- **Live Thoth awareness** — Buddy receives chat streaming, thinking, tool, approval, workflow, notification, and voice-state events from existing runtime paths.
- **Single configured identity** — Buddy surfaces no longer render a separate companion name or duplicate Buddy-name setting; the assistant identity remains owned by Preferences, while Buddy UI focuses on state, personality, and motion.
- **Desktop overlay route** — adds `/buddy-overlay` plus pywebview helpers for a named Buddy window where native overlay support is available.

### Buddy Motion & UI Polish

- **Generated animation boundary** — Buddy ships with bundled first-party `glyph`, `lumen`, `ember`, `pixel`, `sprout`, and `orbit` motion packs. Hatch-generated custom Buddy art and compact image-to-video motion packs are copied into Thoth's served Buddy assets, while normal playback switches locally across idle, thinking, working, approval, success, and error states without runtime model calls.
- **Generated pack quality** — Hatch prompts request keyable backgrounds, frame padding, and rim-lit dark edges so generated packs preserve character detail during transparency compositing; Google Veo starts are paced during fresh bundled regenerations, and runtime corner-keying is gentler so bundled pack edges stay intact.
- **Motion semantics** — approval, denial, timeout, cancellation, interruption, and completion states now map to explicit Buddy clips; MP4 playback crossfades state changes, smooths loop restarts, and replays idle motion periodically without looking busy.
- **Dockable in-app presence** — Buddy starts inside a sidebar home circle, can be dragged into the workspace, leaves the sidebar dock visibly empty while away, snaps home when released near the dock, and returns home on app restart instead of persisting a stray position.
- **Settings polish** — Buddy Settings groups where Buddy appears, behavior, look, and generated-motion guidance in a dense Models-tab-style layout. Visual pack selection uses preview tiles, clears stale Hatch overrides when a bundled pack is selected, and refreshes existing in-app and desktop clients.
- **Hatch save recovery** — saving Buddy settings now preserves freshly generated Hatch art and motion pointers instead of falling back to the selected bundled pack. Hatch outputs are promoted into selectable user packs, still-only generated art remains valid when motion is poor or unavailable, generated packs can be switched back to still-only mode, generated Hatch packs can be deleted from the picker, motion retry regenerates the selected user-generated still without overwriting the selectable pack manifest, and new motion requests use provider-compatible 5-second clips. Full Buddy generation now runs as a background job with Home status-bar progress, completion notifications, and private baked-in still/video prompts so simple user concepts do not turn into pose sheets; the visible concept field stays clean while internal personality/style guidance remains private. Generated Hatch motion now preserves full-frame opaque stills and uses the same cover-framed corner-keying path as bundled motion packs, while transparent stills are composited onto a stable keyable background before video generation; existing Hatch packs whose manifest was overwritten by retry metadata are recovered when loaded, and stopping a workflow immediately moves Buddy out of the running-workflow state.

### Buddy Desktop Overlay Reliability

- **Native overlay stability** — desktop Buddy preserves important approval, denial, workflow, and error bubbles even in Quiet mode, keeps bubbles visible across rapid state settling, applies first-paint transparent document styling, and reveals only after the transparent Buddy document has painted.
- **Window creation fallback** — the native overlay retries with simpler pywebview options if a backend rejects transparency or hidden-window hints, avoids snapshot pushes into deleted NiceGUI clients, and guards startup health-check results so transient `None` values cannot crash the native window.
- **Workflow state cleanup** — approval denials and timeouts clear approval and workflow activity immediately; denied, timed-out, stopped, or cancelled workflow endings clear Buddy workflow-step state; successful multi-step workflow endings emit `done` instead of a misleading cancellation.

### Models, Vision & Settings Reliability

- **Settings and timer stability** — Settings -> Models opens the provider/model catalog lazily and caps provider rows so very large catalogs no longer crash the UI, while NiceGUI one-shot and polling timers clean up when clients disconnect or parent slots are deleted instead of flooding logs with deleted-slot errors.
- **Model catalog and picker clarity** — installed local Ollama chat models appear in Settings -> Models even when their family is not yet in Thoth's curated tool/vision capability lists. Brain and Vision pickers now make it clear that catalog rows must be pinned before they appear as everyday choices.
- **ChatGPT / Codex Vision pins** — Codex Vision pins keep their provider-specific image-input capability during Quick Choice refreshes, and the Codex Responses transport preserves multimodal image blocks so captured screenshots are sent to Codex Vision models instead of being flattened to text-only requests.
- **Vision and setting updates** — `thoth_update_setting` validates Brain and Vision model changes against Quick Choices, installed local Ollama models, and provider catalog rows before saving, exposes an explicit `vision_model` setting, and rejects invented or unavailable model names with actionable guidance.

### Linux & Startup Reliability

- **Linux launcher install-path fix** — the generated Linux launcher resolves installed symlink chains before computing the app root, so `~/.local/bin/thoth` starts the packaged app from `~/.local/share/thoth/current`; release CI smokes through the installed user launcher path.
- **Linux packaged startup resilience** — packaged Linux launches now report startup log tails, child-process exit details, configurable `THOTH_STARTUP_TIMEOUT`, and targeted hints for native OpenCV/FAISS/NumPy dependency failures. Camera and screenshot capture degrade gracefully if OpenCV/MSS cannot import instead of blocking app startup.
- **Linux native CPU-baseline compatibility** — packaged Python builds now keep NumPy below the newer Linux x86_64 wheel line that can require `x86-64-v2` CPU instructions, and Linux package builds scan embedded native libraries for `x86-64-v2/v3/v4` requirements before upload to prevent startup crashes on older x86_64 machines.
- **Linux installer UX hardening** — source-checkout builds support the root-level `bash build_linux_app.sh <version>` support command, install success messages print `~/.local/bin/thoth` when `~/.local/bin` is not on `PATH`, and maintainer docs distinguish unreleased tarball testing from the one-line installer that resolves published GitHub Release assets.
- **Optional native package diagnostics** — startup detects installed-but-broken optional native packages such as TorchCodec, logs a concrete recovery command, and makes Transformers treat broken TorchCodec as unavailable instead of letting optional audio/video helpers crash Thoth during startup.
- **Windows embedded-Python repair hardening** — Windows installer repair/upgrade replaces the bundled `{app}\python` runtime before copying the new payload, preventing manually installed or corrupted packages from surviving an over-the-top reinstall.

### Tests & Release Checks

- **Buddy coverage** — focused tests cover core event/config/asset behavior, Hatch motion activation, UTF-8 config loading, UI wiring, event source hooks, runtime fallback behavior, dockable in-app behavior, built-in motion semantics, and packaging inclusion. Manual-style browser smokes verify docked, undocked, and overlay playback from the bundled pack.
- **Reliability coverage** — startup hardening tests cover broken TorchCodec detection, Linux native dependency recovery hints, NumPy `x86-64-v2` startup failures, launcher log-tail diagnostics, Windows installer embedded-Python replacement, app import smoke, Settings -> Models catalog bounds and picker guidance, status-tool model validation, safe timer cleanup, and installed Linux launcher symlink/default invocation resolution.
- **Provider/Vision coverage** — provider tests cover ChatGPT / Codex Vision Quick Choice capability retention and Codex Responses multimodal image payload preservation.
- **Release smoke** — release and CI workflows build Windows, macOS, and Linux artifacts for v3.21.0, run focused startup/provider suites before installer builds, and smoke the installed Linux launcher path.
- **Test layout cleanup** — root-level test files now live under `tests/`, pytest discovers that folder by default, CI/release workflows call the moved paths, and installer regressions assert the `tests/` tree is not shipped in Windows, Linux, or macOS packages.
- **Current validation** — focused release tests pass (`110 passed, 2 skipped`), the legacy release smoke suite reports `ALL TESTS PASSED!`, full `pytest -q` passes (`255 passed, 3 skipped`), `git diff --check` is clean, stale-version search only finds the previous release's historical changelog section, and `docs/index.html` remains untouched.

### Release Notes & Risk Notes

- **Desktop overlay support varies by platform** — Buddy's in-app surface is the primary supported experience; the native transparent desktop overlay depends on pywebview/backend support and may fall back to simpler window options.
- **Generated Buddy assets are optional** — bundled motion packs run locally with no model call; Hatch-generated Buddy art/motion requires the configured image/video generation providers and their normal quotas/rate limits.
- **Linux native capture dependencies are optional** — missing OpenCV/MSS native libraries should not block startup, but camera and screenshot tools remain unavailable until the relevant platform packages are installed.
- **Landing page update deferred** — `docs/index.html` is intentionally not updated in this release-prep pass; download links and website version text will be updated separately after the v3.21.0 release assets are published.

## v3.20.0 — Linux Support, MiniMax, Custom Setup, Linux & Ollama Reliability

This release extends the provider runtime work with **MiniMax** as a first-class API-key provider, a cleaner first-run path for custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints, real Linux packaging, and stronger local Ollama connection handling for Windows and custom host setups.

### 🐧 Linux Support

- **Self-contained Linux tarball** — releases now include `Thoth-X.Y.Z-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz`, built with python-build-standalone and the same source-copy contract as the macOS app bundle
- **One-line Linux install** — `installer/install-linux.sh` lets users install with a single `curl ... | bash` command while still verifying the release tarball SHA256 before running the bundled installer
- **XDG user install** — `install.sh` installs under `~/.local/share/thoth/releases/<version>`, updates `~/.local/share/thoth/current`, creates `~/.local/bin/thoth`, and installs a freedesktop desktop entry plus icon
- **Browser-first baseline** — Linux opens in the system browser by default and does not require pywebview, GTK/Qt, AppIndicator, or tray libraries to run
- **Optional native/tray modes** — `launcher.py --native` and `launcher.py --tray` remain available for Linux desktops with the relevant system libraries
- **Server mode** — `launcher.py --server --no-open --port <port>` supports headless Linux smoke and server-style launches
- **Linux updater path** — the updater can select Linux tarball assets, verify the SHA256 release manifest, install into the user-owned release tree, flip the `current` symlink, and restart through `~/.local/bin/thoth`
- **Headless keyring handling** — WSL and server Linux environments without Secret Service/KWallet now treat secure storage as unavailable without traceback spam; new secrets remain session-only rather than falling back to plaintext files

### 🧠 Providers & Setup

- **MiniMax provider support** — MiniMax M2 models can be connected as a first-class API-key provider through MiniMax's Anthropic-compatible endpoint, with catalog rows, provider labels, setup/settings key entry, `MINIMAX_API_KEY` support, and runtime routing through the existing Anthropic transport
- **Anthropic-compatible transport cleanup** — MiniMax now uses the same consolidated system-message handling required by Anthropic-style Messages APIs, avoiding failures from multiple non-consecutive system messages
- **MiniMax key validation** — credentials accepted by MiniMax but blocked by the documented insufficient-balance response are treated as valid credentials with a billing/account warning instead of as invalid keys
- **Custom/Self-hosted setup path** — first-run setup now supports Custom/Self-hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoints such as LM Studio alongside the normal Providers path for API-key users

### 🖥️ Ollama & Native Launcher Reliability

- **Ollama host parsing** — `OLLAMA_HOST` values with explicit ports and URL forms are parsed correctly for local daemon checks instead of assuming the default `11434` port
- **Ollama wildcard-host compatibility** — when `OLLAMA_HOST` is set to a bind wildcard such as `0.0.0.0` or `::`, Thoth now connects through a loopback client endpoint while preserving the configured port, so setup, model listing, downloads, local chat, vision, and dream-cycle busy checks do not incorrectly report Ollama as disconnected
- **Local vision model catalog restore** — Ollama and Custom/Self-hosted OpenAI-compatible catalogs now infer vision support for local model families such as Gemma 3, LLaVA variants, Moondream, MiniCPM-V, and Qwen-VL, so LM Studio and installed Ollama vision models appear in the Vision tab again
- **Free-port launcher startup** — the desktop launcher now verifies that a listener on `8080` is actually Thoth before reusing it; if another local service owns the port, Thoth starts on the next available local port instead of opening the foreign service
- **Session port source of truth** — the launcher passes the selected port through `THOTH_PORT`, and the NiceGUI app, main-app tunnel, SMS webhook registration, workflow webhook route, Settings tunnel toggle, and Designer published-link fallback all use that active app port
- **Launcher identity probe** — `/api/launcher-ping` lets the tray distinguish an existing Thoth instance from unrelated services while preserving direct `python app.py` launches on port `8080` by default
- **Linux-safe launcher modes** — the launcher now has explicit `--browser`, `--native`, `--tray`, `--no-tray`, `--server`, `--no-open`, `--port`, and `--host` flags; Windows and macOS keep their existing tray-first behavior while Linux defaults to browser/no-tray
- **Wayland clipboard fallback** — native-window clipboard access tries `wl-paste` before the existing `xclip` fallback on Linux

### 🧪 Tests & Release Checks

- **MiniMax provider coverage** — focused tests cover provider catalog wiring, runtime construction, key validation behavior, setup/settings surfaces, static model rows, and Anthropic-compatible message consolidation
- **Ollama endpoint regressions** — provider runtime tests cover `OLLAMA_HOST` variants including custom ports, URL forms, `0.0.0.0`, and IPv6 wildcard binds
- **Vision catalog regressions** — provider catalog tests cover installed/recommended Ollama vision rows plus LM Studio-style custom endpoint models with sparse OpenAI-compatible metadata
- **Launcher/app-port coverage** — app-port tests validate dynamic port selection, Thoth identity probing, and active-port propagation
- **Linux smoke coverage** — Ubuntu CI now launches the app and checks `/api/launcher-ping`; release CI builds the Linux tarball, unpacks it, runs the packaged launcher in server mode, and checks both `/api/launcher-ping` and the root UI page
- **Current validation** — focused Linux/app-port/secret-storage regression tests pass locally; full `test_suite.py` and `pytest -q` remain final release-gate checks before publishing artifacts

### ⚠️ Release Notes & Risk Notes

- **LM Studio custom endpoint smoke** — when testing LM Studio through the Custom/Self-hosted setup path, load the selected model with enough context for Thoth's agent prompt and enabled tool schemas. A `4096` context can fail with a misleading prompt-template error such as `No user query found in messages`; `32768` is a practical smoke-test baseline.

### 📁 Files Changed

## v3.19.0 — Provider Runtime Foundation & ChatGPT / Codex

Thoth's model layer has been rebuilt around a first-class **provider runtime**. API-key providers, local Ollama models, custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints, media providers, and ChatGPT / Codex subscription access now flow through one provider-aware catalog and picker system instead of a mix of legacy cloud lists, starred models, and per-screen dropdown logic.

This release also adds **ChatGPT / Codex** as a distinct subscription-backed provider. It is intentionally separate from OpenAI API-key access: Codex uses an in-app ChatGPT sign-in, keeps Thoth-owned tokens in the OS credential store, and labels duplicate model names as `OpenAI API` versus `ChatGPT / Codex` so users always know which route they are using.

### 🧠 Provider Runtime Foundation

- **New `providers/` subsystem** — provider definitions, metadata-only config, keyring-backed provider secrets, catalog normalization, runtime construction, status summaries, error normalization, Quick Choices, custom endpoint support, and routing-profile foundations now live in one dedicated package
- **Provider runtime facade** — OpenAI, OpenRouter, Anthropic, Google AI, xAI, custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints, Ollama catalog rows, and ChatGPT / Codex all route through a shared runtime layer while preserving the public `models.py` compatibility API
- **Stable model refs** — provider-backed picker values use refs such as `model:openai:gpt-5.5` and `model:codex:gpt-5.5`, keeping identical raw model IDs distinct across providers
- **Provider-aware labels** — duplicate model names now show route labels such as `GPT-5.5 — OpenAI API` and `GPT-5.5 — ChatGPT / Codex` in chat, Designer, workflow, status, and settings pickers
- **Metadata-only provider config** — `providers.json` stores provider state, Quick Choices, catalog cache, fingerprints, and status metadata; raw API keys and OAuth tokens stay in the OS credential store when available
- **Status and insight awareness** — Thoth Status now exposes provider-aware model/runtime context and an `insights` category, while Dream Cycle Phase 5 includes model/provider/media context in its system snapshot before generating actionable insights
- **Custom endpoint foundation** — custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints can be saved, refreshed, and surfaced as provider catalog rows without overloading the built-in OpenAI provider

### ⚙️ Settings → Providers & Settings → Models

- **Providers tab cleanup** — the old Cloud surface is now **Providers**. It focuses on provider connection state, API keys, ChatGPT / Codex sign-in, health, refresh, setup guidance, and custom endpoint management
- **Models tab ownership** — model browsing, raw provider catalogs, local Ollama catalog rows, pin/unpin actions, defaults, and Quick Choices now live in **Settings → Models**
- **Consolidated Model Catalog** — a category-first catalog groups Brain, Vision, Image, and Video-capable rows by provider, with inline actions for pinning, setting defaults, downloading local models, and clearing disabled reasons
- **Polished Defaults panel** — Brain, Vision, Image, and Video defaults use compact provider/local badges, context controls, enable switches, and empty states that point users to the catalog instead of scattering model controls across tabs
- **First-run setup alignment** — setup now offers migration before model setup, supports the Providers path for API-key users, and points users to Settings → Models for exact model pinning after launch

### 💬 Picker Unification

- **One picker source** — chat header overrides, live chat model override, background workflow model override, Designer inline model selection, Telegram `/model`, and Thoth Status model updates all use the same provider-aware Quick Choice helpers
- **Surface-specific choices** — Brain, Vision, Image, and Video surfaces filter models by capability so media-only models do not leak into normal chat and chat-only models do not appear as image/video options
- **Legacy compatibility** — existing starred cloud models and bare model IDs are migrated or resolved without breaking saved settings, while new provider-backed selections preserve their provider route
- **Runtime banner cleanup** — chat status now uses dynamic provider display labels, so custom providers and ChatGPT / Codex show accurate route names instead of hardcoded cloud labels

### 🔐 ChatGPT / Codex Subscription Provider

- **In-app ChatGPT sign-in** — direct Codex runtime requires Thoth's device-flow ChatGPT sign-in and stores Thoth-owned OAuth tokens in the OS credential store
- **CLI auth boundary** — external Codex CLI auth files are display-safe metadata/reference hints only. Thoth can show that a CLI login exists, but it does not copy runnable tokens from `~/.codex/auth.json`
- **Live Codex catalog** — ChatGPT / Codex catalog discovery uses `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/models?client_version=1.0.0` when OAuth runtime credentials are present, caches display-safe metadata, filters hidden/internal rows, and falls back to documented subscription models when live discovery is unavailable
- **Responses transport** — `ChatCodexResponses` handles the ChatGPT/Codex Responses SSE backend, bearer/account headers, streaming text, function-call chunks, tool-call replay, and 401 refresh retry behavior
- **Tool-call parity** — Codex streaming now emits LangChain tool-call chunks, so normal chat can execute tools instead of ending with empty assistant messages when Codex asks for workspace/tool context
- **Current-turn fallback** — checkpoint fallback only uses an AI answer from the current submitted turn, preventing stale prior assistant text from being replayed after an empty streaming turn

### 🖼️ Media Providers & Model Catalog

- **Image/video model routing** — image generation and video generation models participate in provider-aware selection, catalog pinning, and surface filtering
- **Provider media status** — Thoth Status and Models settings can report media provider availability and selected image/video models without treating media rows as Brain models
- **Ollama catalog parity** — downloadable Ollama rows appear as non-runnable catalog entries until installed, with local download actions in the Models catalog
- **Vision reuse** — provider models with image capability can be detected and reused by the Vision feature alongside local vision models

### 🎨 Designer & Streaming Reliability

- **Detached stream cleanup** — long Designer/browser sessions now clear terminal active-generation bookkeeping when the graph finishes, even if the browser client disconnects during streaming
- **Final-response hydration** — detached completions reload active thread messages from LangGraph checkpoints before rebuilding the UI, so final assistant prose appears after reconnect instead of being hidden behind stale in-memory state
- **Stored HTML normalization** — Designer project HTML no longer persists render-time `data:image/...base64` payloads; stored projects keep canonical `asset://...` references while preview/export resolves assets at render time
- **Preview timer cleanup** — Designer preview polling timers deactivate on client disconnect or deleted-parent errors instead of continuing to touch removed NiceGUI clients
- **Stale-run recovery** — sending a new Designer/chat message can drop stale terminal generation entries while still blocking truly live runs

### 💻 Claude Code Delegation Skill

- **New bundled skill** — `bundled_skills/claude_code_delegation/SKILL.md` teaches Thoth how to coordinate Claude Code CLI as an external coding worker for implementation, review, refactor, and larger repository tasks
- **Thoth remains coordinator** — the skill keeps Thoth responsible for scoping the request, checking local state, choosing the narrowest Claude Code tool permissions, inspecting diffs, running verification, and explaining results to the user
- **Approval-gated shell workflow** — Claude Code runs through Thoth's shell workflow with explicit working-directory checks, bounded print-mode commands, `--allowedTools`, `--max-turns`, optional budget limits, and no permission bypass unless the user explicitly asks
- **Secret and safety boundaries** — the skill warns not to forward API keys, Thoth memory, private notes, or sensitive user data to Claude Code unless explicitly requested, and it forbids destructive git, deploy, production migration, and secret-handling delegation without clear user approval
- **Interactive mode guidance** — print mode is preferred; interactive/tmux-style Claude Code orchestration is documented as advanced and best suited to macOS/Linux/WSL2 with explicit cleanup

### 🧪 Tests & Release Checks

- **Focused provider suites** — new provider tests cover config normalization/masking, keyring namespace storage and chunking, provider catalog inference, model selection refs, media model filtering, custom endpoints, runtime construction, and ChatGPT / Codex OAuth/catalog/transport behavior
- **Bundled skill coverage** — the main suite validates `claude_code_delegation` as a bundled skill and checks the skill parser/discovery path that loads it
- **Designer regressions** — `test_suite.py` covers detached finalization cleanup, stale terminal generation recovery, deleted-client detach detection, Designer asset canonicalization, preview timer cleanup, and checkpoint hydration for detached final answers
- **Release smoke** — `test_suite.py` validates v3.19.0 version consistency across `version.py`, Windows installer, macOS app plist, CI release workflow, bug report template, and install dependencies
- **Packaging smoke** — Windows installer coverage includes recursive `providers/` plus `ui/model_catalog.py` and `ui/provider_settings.py`; macOS app packaging includes `providers` and the full `ui` package
- **Clean first-run smoke** — a temporary `THOTH_DATA_DIR` import/config check confirms setup wizard and provider config load cleanly before any provider state exists
- **Final validation** — direct `test_suite.py` passes with the release-smoke checks, and full `pytest -q` passes with `159 passed, 1 skipped`

### ⚠️ Release Notes & Risk Notes

- **Codex runtime sign-in** — ChatGPT / Codex models only run after an in-app ChatGPT sign-in stores Thoth-owned OAuth tokens in the local OS credential store
- **Subscription backend risk** — ChatGPT / Codex uses ChatGPT's subscription/internal Codex backend rather than the public OpenAI API. The endpoint, catalog shape, auth requirements, rate limits, and model availability may change upstream without the same stability guarantees as the public API
- **Privacy** — when a ChatGPT / Codex model is selected, the current conversation plus model-visible tool context and tool results are sent to ChatGPT / Codex for that turn. Durable Thoth data such as memories, documents, files, and other conversations stay local unless explicitly included in the active conversation or exposed through a tool result
- **Manual smoke still required** — before publishing installers, run clean-machine Windows/macOS smoke for first launch, Settings → Providers, Settings → Models catalog/pinning/defaults, ChatGPT / Codex sign-in/status, shared model pickers, and a long Designer/browser task with reconnect

## v3.18.0 — External MCP Tools, Migration Wizard & Secure API Keys

Thoth now has a full **Model Context Protocol client** for connecting external MCP servers as native dynamic tools without letting a broken server take down the app. This release also adds a guarded **Hermes/OpenClaw migration wizard** in Preferences, moves normal core and plugin API-key saves into the OS credential store, and fixes a cloud-model default regression where a saved GPT/Claude/Gemini/Grok/OpenRouter model could be replaced by a local Ollama fallback when the cloud-model cache was empty.

The MCP runtime supports stdio, Streamable HTTP, and SSE transports; handles tool, resource, and prompt surfaces; classifies destructive tools; routes risky actions through Thoth's existing interrupt approvals; and keeps all external server config isolated in `mcp_servers.json`. Marketplace search can pull from curated starters plus MCP directories, while dependency handling covers common user-space runtimes such as Node.js, uv, and Playwright Chromium, leaving heavier requirements like Docker as clear manual setup tasks.

### 🔌 MCP Client & Dynamic Tools

- **New `mcp_client/` subsystem** — persistent config, runtime sessions, result normalization, safety classification, marketplace discovery, dependency checks, and structured diagnostics live under a dedicated package instead of being mixed into built-in tool code
- **Native parent tool** — new `tools/mcp_tool.py` registers **External MCP Tools** as the parent toggle; actual MCP server tools are injected dynamically through `as_langchain_tools()` after discovery
- **Namespaced tool wrappers** — MCP tools are exposed as `mcp_<server>_<tool>` so external tool names cannot collide with native tools or each other
- **Transport support** — stdio, Streamable HTTP, and SSE servers are supported through the Python MCP SDK, with per-server connect timeout, tool timeout, output cap, environment, headers, working directory, and command/URL settings
- **Resources and prompts** — MCP resources and prompts can be exposed as optional utility tools per server, separately from the server's normal tool list
- **Model-facing output normalization** — text, structured content, embedded resources, links, image/binary blocks, errors, empty responses, and oversized outputs are normalized before they reach the LLM

### 🛡️ Safety, Permissions & Fault Isolation

- **Global kill switch** — disabling MCP stops active sessions, clears the runtime catalog, removes dynamic MCP tools from the agent, and keeps the saved server configuration for later re-enable
- **Per-server and per-tool toggles** — users can enable the MCP client globally, then choose exactly which servers and tools are active
- **Destructive-tool gates** — tools whose names, descriptions, or MCP annotations indicate write/send/delete/run/deploy/payment-style behavior require approval; destructive tools are not auto-enabled after discovery
- **Native capability overlap labels** — servers that overlap built-in Thoth memory, browser, filesystem/document, web search, channel, or Designer capabilities are labeled and require manual tool selection
- **Untrusted external output handling** — MCP guide instructions tell the agent to treat MCP results as untrusted external content and prefer native Thoth tools for Thoth-owned capabilities
- **Startup-safe design** — missing SDKs, bad JSON config, missing commands, failed child processes, broken endpoints, and server connection failures degrade to status rows and logs instead of blocking Thoth startup
- **Shutdown cleanup** — app shutdown now closes MCP child sessions so external stdio processes are not left behind

### 🧭 Settings UI, Import & Marketplace Search

- **Settings → MCP tab** — add/edit/import/test/refresh/delete MCP servers from the GUI with the same simple enable-checkbox pattern as built-in tools
- **Tool review surface** — after a successful test, discovered tools show descriptions, input schema summaries, destructive/approval badges, enable checkboxes, and approval toggles for non-destructive tools
- **Import disabled by default** — JSON imports and marketplace entries are saved disabled until tested and reviewed
- **Curated starter catalog** — recommended entries cover common external MCP use cases while preserving risk, trust, overlap, and requirement metadata
- **Directory search** — marketplace search can use official registry-style sources plus PulseMCP, Smithery, and Glama adapters with cache/curated fallback when live sources are unavailable or irrelevant
- **Diagnostics dialog** — masked config plus live runtime status are available from the MCP settings surface for troubleshooting without exposing secrets

### 🔄 Hermes & OpenClaw Migration Wizard

- **Preferences-launched wizard** — Settings → Preferences now exposes an **Open Migration Wizard** action instead of a permanent top-level migration tab, keeping this one-time setup flow out of the main settings sidebar
- **Supported sources** — detects and plans imports from Hermes Agent (`.hermes`) and OpenClaw (`.openclaw`, legacy `.clawdbot` / `.moltbot`) with provider-mismatch guards so the wrong source type does not produce a misleading partial plan
- **Preview-first flow** — scan builds a dry-run plan only; apply requires explicit review and writes only the currently selected items
- **Mapped data** — imports identity/persona files, memory files, daily OpenClaw memory, skills, model/provider settings, disabled MCP server definitions, and opt-in API keys/tokens
- **Manual-review boundaries** — channels, approvals, browser, cron, hooks, tools, broad runtime state, and unknown/risky source data stay skipped or archive-only instead of being activated live
- **Backups and reports** — existing targets are backed up before replacement, repeated writes to the same target preserve the original once per run, and every apply writes `plan.json`, `result.json`, `backup_manifest.json`, and `summary.md`
- **Secret redaction** — migration reports redact secret-shaped values and archive snapshots redact JSON/key-value files; API key import remains an explicit opt-in
- **MCP safety** — migrated MCP server definitions stay disabled until reviewed, so a bad imported server cannot break startup or automatically expose risky external tools

### 🔐 API Key Secure Storage

- **OS credential store** — saved core and plugin API keys now use the platform keyring through `keyring` instead of normal plaintext JSON storage
- **Metadata-only file** — `~/.thoth/api_keys.json` stores saved-state, keyring service, timestamps, and masked fingerprints, not raw API key values
- **Plugin secret parity** — plugin-declared API keys use the same keyring-backed path with metadata-only `plugin_secrets.json` state
- **Legacy migration** — existing plaintext `api_keys.json` files are imported into the keyring on load; if the OS keyring is unavailable, Thoth keeps legacy keys readable with a warning instead of crashing startup
- **No silent plaintext fallback** — new saves during keyring failure become session-only rather than creating new plaintext API-key files
- **Safer Settings UI** — saved keys are not prefilled into password fields; blank inputs leave existing keys unchanged and clear actions are explicit
- **Migration integration** — selected Hermes/OpenClaw API keys route through target-profile secure storage and migration reports remain redacted

### 🧠 Cloud Model Defaults

- **Cache-empty provider inference** — GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, and slash-style OpenRouter model IDs are recognized as cloud models even before the provider cache has been refreshed
- **Default preservation** — `refresh_cloud_models()` no longer rewrites a saved cloud default to a local Ollama fallback simply because keys, network access, or provider discovery are temporarily unavailable
- **Regression coverage** — `test_suite.py` now checks provider inference, cache-empty cloud detection, and preservation of saved cloud defaults such as `gpt-5.5`

### ⚙️ Runtime Requirements

- **Requirement detection** — stdio servers infer required launchers from commands such as `npx`, `uvx`, and `docker`, plus Playwright browser requirements for Playwright MCP
- **Managed easy installs** — Thoth can install private user-space Node.js LTS, uv, and Playwright Chromium runtimes under `~/.thoth/runtimes/` without packaging those runtimes inside Thoth
- **Manual complex installs** — non-trivial system dependencies such as Docker are surfaced with setup guidance instead of being bundled or silently installed
- **Managed environment injection** — resolved runtime paths are added only to the MCP child process environment, avoiding global PATH mutation

### 🧠 Agent, Status & Guide Integration

- **Tool display names** — dynamic MCP calls render with readable labels such as `MCP: microsoft_docs_search (microsoft-learn-mcp)` in tool-call UI
- **Browser-loop controls** — MCP browser tools participate in Thoth's browser snapshot trimming and loop-control logic so long browsing runs do not flood context
- **Background workflow safety** — destructive MCP tools respect the workflow safety mode: approval-required modes interrupt, while explicit allow-all mode can run enabled destructive MCP tools
- **Thoth Status integration** — `thoth_update_setting` can enable/disable the global MCP client through the normal tool-toggle path, keeping the parent registry tool and runtime state synchronized
- **New MCP tool guide** — `tool_guides/mcp_guide/SKILL.md` documents when to use external MCP tools, how to treat MCP output, how to handle MCP errors, and how global disable behaves

### 🧪 Tests & Release Checks

- **Focused offline suite** — new `test_mcp_client.py` covers bad config fallback, secret masking, destructive detection, marketplace fallback/filtering, conflict policy, runtime requirement inference, managed runtime env injection, settings rows, stdio discovery/call, tool enable/approval toggles, global MCP disable, bad server failure, display names, background safety, and MCP browser loop controls
- **Opt-in live suite** — new `test_mcp_real_world_e2e.py` plus `scripts/mcp_real_world_e2e.py` validate real public MCP servers outside normal CI, including Microsoft Learn and Context7
- **Main regression coverage** — `test_suite.py` includes MCP modules in import/consistency checks and validates the focused MCP test files are part of the tracked suite
- **Migration regression suite** — new `test_migration_core.py`, `test_migration_detection.py`, `test_migration_planner.py`, `test_migration_apply.py`, and `test_migration_wizard_ui.py` cover source detection, wrong-provider guards, dry-run planning, conflict behavior, backup/report generation, redaction, daily memory import, UI helper behavior, and Preferences placement
- **API key storage suite** — new `test_api_key_storage.py` covers keyring-backed writes, metadata-only files, legacy plaintext migration, keyring-unavailable fallback, session-only new saves, and delete behavior

## v3.17.0 — Designer Studio II: Interactive Modes, Video Gen & Review Flow

Designer graduates from a single-mode deck authoring tool into a full multi-mode design studio. Five project modes now ship — **deck**, **document**, **landing page**, **app mockup**, and **storyboard** — each with its own canvas rules, prompt guardrails, and curated template gallery. Interactive modes (landing / app_mockup / storyboard) run on a new sandboxed **runtime bridge** that turns declarative `data-row-bot-action` attributes into real in-preview navigation, state toggles, and media playback without letting the agent write free-form `<script>`. A new **video generation tool** joins image generation as a first-class asset producer. A surgical tool surface — move, duplicate, restyle, refine-text, add-chart, insert-component, critique-page, apply-repairs — lets the agent edit pages without rewriting HTML. A new **review dialog** and **mutation diff** show exactly what changed turn over turn. The agent is bound by mode-specific **content budgets** and a **post-critique repair loop** so pages no longer clip at the canvas edge. Editable PPTX export is rewritten around isolated-page rasters so overlapping text no longer bleeds between slides. Designer assets now live under a **shared `utils/`** layer, and the home UI picks up bulk-select, skeleton loading, confirm dialogs, and richer sidebar + status bar states. Outside Designer, Thoth ships its own **in-app auto-updater** — packaged Windows and macOS builds now check GitHub Releases in the background, surface an `⬆ vX.Y.Z` pill in the status bar, and install SHA256- and code-signature-verified updates without leaving the app.

### 🎨 Designer — Five Modes & Interactive Runtime

Designer is no longer deck-only. Each mode has dedicated canvas semantics, prompt guidance, template gallery, and preview behaviour.

- **Five project modes** — `deck`, `document`, `landing`, `app_mockup`, `storyboard` with mode-aware canvas rules (fixed-slide vs. scrollable vs. device viewport) and mode-aware prompt injection
- **Interactive runtime bridge** — new `designer/runtime/` ships a sandboxed JS + CSS bridge loaded into preview, export, and published output; the agent uses declarative `data-row-bot-action="navigate:…"`, `toggle_state:…`, and `play_media:…` attributes instead of `<script>` tags or `on*` handlers
- **Multi-route / multi-screen projects** — `designer/page_navigator.py`, `designer/route_graph.py`, and `designer/interaction.py` let landing, app_mockup, and storyboard projects chain screens with real transitions (`fade`, `slide_left`, `slide_up`) and state-scoped overlays
- **Hotspot recorder** — new `designer/hotspot_recorder.py` turns a click on any preview element into a wired navigate or toggle action without hand-editing HTML
- **Command palette** — new `designer/command_palette.py` gives keyboard-driven access to every designer tool
- **Zero-state quick-starts** — new `designer/zero_state.py` shows per-mode starter chips when a project is empty; the first-draft CTA and quick-start panel now dismiss themselves as soon as the user commits
- **Template gallery overhaul** — `designer/template_gallery.py` and `designer/templates.py` add curated starters for every mode (pitch deck, brief, landing hero, three-route app scaffold, four-shot storyboard, SaaS dashboard, and more), upload-as-template, brand preset selection, and attached-file persistence through the setup flow

### 🖼️ Media, Image Placement & Video Generation

Designer media becomes more structured and more correct — agent-generated images land in the right containers, and video is a first-class asset type.

- **Typed image slots + 5-path resolver** — `designer/ai_content.py` now fills images through (1) `data-row-bot-image-slot` / `data-row-bot-shot-visual` typed slots, (2) `position="replace:SELECTOR"` targeting, (3) heuristic empty-placeholder detection covering hero/product/photo/recipe/screen/phone/card visuals, (4) blank `<img>` replacement, and (5) an overlay fallback as a last resort
- **Correct cover sizing** — when a wrapped image fragment drops into a slot, `object-fit:cover` is applied to the actual `<img>`/`<video>` element instead of an outer `<div>` where the property has no effect; stale width/height/margin from authored placeholders is stripped
- **Video generation tool** — new `tools/video_gen_tool.py` plus `tool_guides/video_guide/` give Thoth a first-class video-generation surface with provider routing and documented guidance
- **Editable PPTX raster isolation** — `designer/export.py` opens a fresh Playwright page per slide raster, captures `src`/`objectFit`/`objectPosition` for `<img>` and `svgOuterHTML` for inline `<svg>`, and renders at `device_scale_factor=2` so structured PPTX exports match the preview without text bleeding between slides
- **Shared media helpers** — new `utils/media.py` and `utils/text.py` centralise asset normalisation used by Designer, export, and channels

### 🧠 Agent Authoring Guardrails & Critique Loop

Mode-specific content budgets and a mandatory repair loop stop the agent from shipping clipped, overlapping, or cramped pages.

- **Content budgets per mode** — `designer/prompt.py` now enforces explicit per-page limits: document (130–160 words, ≥32–48 px bottom padding), deck (≤5 bullets, heading ≤4.5rem, 64–96 px edges), storyboard (one eyebrow + heading + paragraph + ≤2 metadata cards + direction + footer strip), landing (responsive sections with real padding), app_mockup (fixed device viewport with status/tab chrome)
- **Authoring rules** — explicit guidance forbids decorative CSS art stacked on top of heading text, requires horizontal button rows with distinct ghost/outline secondaries, and mandates typed image slots over absolute-positioned overlays
- **Post-critique repair loop** — after major rewrites the agent must call `designer_critique_page` and then either `designer_apply_repairs(["overflow"])` or split content to an additional page via `designer_add_page`; no mode ships a clipped page
- **Expanded overflow detection** — `designer/critique.py` now flags card-heavy pages (≥7 card-like `<div>`s) in addition to section-heavy pages, catching storyboards and dashboards the old heuristic missed
- **Brand lint** — new `designer/brand_lint.py` catches hardcoded colours and fonts before they leave the tool
- **Mutation diff + review dialog** — new `designer/mutation_diff.py`, `designer/review.py`, and `designer/review_dialog.py` let the user inspect exactly what the agent changed, page by page, turn over turn

### 🧰 New Designer Tooling

The agent gets a surgical tool surface so it can make targeted edits instead of rewriting full-page HTML.

- **Critique + repair** — `designer_critique_page` reports hierarchy / overflow / contrast / readability / spacing findings; `designer_apply_repairs` applies deterministic fixes for selected categories
- **Curated blocks** — `designer_insert_component` inserts hero callouts, stats bands, testimonials, pricing cards, and timeline steps from a shared component library
- **Surgical element edits** — `designer_move_image`, `designer_replace_image`, `designer_move_element`, `designer_duplicate_element`, `designer_restyle_element`, and `designer_refine_text` preserve existing layout and assets
- **Interactive mode tools** — `designer_add_screen`, `designer_link_screens`, `designer_set_interaction`, `designer_preview_screen`, `designer_reorder_routes`, and `designer_set_mode` drive multi-route editing through the runtime bridge
- **Share, publish, resize** — `designer_publish_link`, `designer_resize_project`, `designer_share_link`, and QR helpers in new `designer/qr_utils.py` round out the share-and-ship path

### 💬 UI & Workflow Updates

The home surface and chat stack pick up quality-of-life improvements shared by Designer and the main chat.

- **Bulk select + confirm dialogs** — new `ui/bulk_select.py` and `ui/confirm.py` give every list-based surface batch actions with a consistent confirm flow
- **Skeleton loading** — new `ui/skeleton.py` renders placeholder blocks while Designer gallery cards, threads, and published links hydrate
- **Timer utilities** — new `ui/timer_utils.py` standardises polling and debounce patterns used across the home tab and designer editor
- **Sidebar + command center** — `ui/sidebar.py` adds richer thread controls, batch operations, and pinned-thread affordances; `ui/command_center.py` tightens the insights panel
- **Chat + streaming refresh** — `ui/chat.py`, `ui/streaming.py`, and `ui/render.py` polish the streaming message area, attachment handling, and tool-call rendering
- **Home tab stability** — `ui/home.py` now polls for the chat container mount before dispatching an initial build so first-draft messages no longer race the UI

### 🛰️ Channels

All four messaging adapters pick up attachment and stability fixes introduced alongside the video generation tool.

- **Shared media capture** — new `channels/media_capture.py` centralises image/audio/document handling reused by Discord, Slack, Telegram, and WhatsApp
- **Discord** — voice-warning suppression and richer attachment flows in `channels/discord_channel.py`
- **Slack / Telegram / WhatsApp** — consistent media attachment, streaming-edit, and link-preview handling across `channels/slack.py`, `channels/telegram.py`, `channels/whatsapp.py`, and the WhatsApp `channels/whatsapp_bridge/bridge.js`

### 🔧 Tools & Status

- **Video generation tool** — new `tools/video_gen_tool.py` with matching `tool_guides/video_guide/`
- **Thoth Status** — `tools/thoth_status_tool.py` adds double-gated model normalisation, video-generation status, and syncs with the updated tool guide in `tool_guides/thoth_status_guide/SKILL.md`
- **Browser tool** — `tools/browser_tool.py` stability fixes
- **X tool** — `tools/x_tool.py` adds OAuth rate-limit-aware health checks
- **Registry** — `tools/__init__.py` and `tools/registry.py` register the video tool alongside existing surfaces

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **First-draft CTA persistence** — the "Build First Draft" button and quick-start panel now delete themselves as soon as the user clicks, instead of lingering over the chat thread
- **First-draft references** — attached files are persisted as project references before the first turn so their extracted content reaches the agent on the initial build
- **Upload handler** — Designer file upload switches to `e.file.read()` with an async/sync dual path, fixing `AttributeError: UploadEventArguments.name` and `NoneType context manager` crashes on the first upload
- **Initial chat container race** — `ui/home.py` polls up to 5 s for the chat container to mount before sending the initial build message instead of silently dropping it
- **PPTX text duplication** — editable PPTX exports no longer overlay overlapping text between slides; each raster is rendered in an isolated Playwright page
- **Image overlay fallback** — agent-generated images land in the correct container via typed slots and heuristic placeholder detection instead of floating as absolute overlays on top of existing content
- **Slot sizing** — inner `<img>` elements get proper `width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover` styles; previously `object-fit` was applied to a wrapper `<div>` where it had no effect

### ⬆ In-App Auto-Updates

Thoth now ships its own background updater so users on packaged Windows / macOS builds get new releases without ever leaving the app.

- **Background scheduler** — new stdlib-only `updater.py` polls the GitHub Releases API on a daemon thread (30-second startup delay, every 6 hours, 24-hour debounce). Checking is on by default; if there's no Internet the call fails silently and the next tick retries. Dev installs (running from a `.git/` checkout) are detected and the scheduler is skipped
- **Status-bar pill** — `ui/status_bar.py` renders an `⬆ vX.Y.Z` chip when a newer release is available; the pill subscribes to updater state-change notifications and clears itself when the user installs or skips
- **What's-New dialog** — new `ui/update_dialog.py` shows the release notes, an **Install now** primary action, and **Skip this version** / **Remind me later** secondary actions; skipped versions and dismissed banners persist to `~/.thoth/update_config.json`
- **Settings surface** — Settings → Preferences → Updates exposes channel selection (stable / beta), the skip list with one-click un-skip, a manual **Check now** button, and the last-checked / last-success timestamps
- **SHA256-verified downloads** — every release body embeds a `<!-- row-bot-update-manifest -->` fenced block (`schema: 1`, per-asset sha256). The updater downloads the platform-specific asset, computes its hash, and refuses to launch the installer on mismatch
- **OS code-signature gate** — Windows runs `signtool.exe verify /pa` (Authenticode); macOS runs `codesign --verify --deep --strict`. A failed signature check aborts the install before the OS installer is launched
- **Per-platform asset routing** — Windows expects `ThothSetup_X.Y.Z.exe`, macOS expects `Thoth-X.Y.Z-macOS-{arm64|x86_64}.dmg`; arch detection picks the right Mac asset automatically
- **Hand-off** — Windows launches the Inno Setup installer in silent mode (`/SILENT /CLOSEAPPLICATIONS /RESTARTAPPLICATIONS`) so it can swap files in place and re-launch Thoth; macOS opens the verified DMG
- **Agent surface** — new `tools/updater_tool.py` registers `thoth_check_for_updates` (read-only) and `thoth_install_update` (interrupt-gated). The dynamic self-knowledge block surfaces "Update available: …" when applicable, and `thoth_status` adds an `updates` category
- **Release plumbing** — new `scripts/append_sha_manifest.py` computes and patches the manifest block into a published GitHub release body; new `.github/workflows/update-manifest.yml` runs it automatically on `release: [published, edited]`; new `.github/workflows/notarize-submit.yml` and `.github/workflows/notarize-check.yml` handle Apple notarization with stapling

### 🧰 Other Changes

- **Shared utilities** — new top-level `utils/` package with `media.py` and `text.py` consolidates helpers previously duplicated across Designer, channels, and export
- **Designer storage & history** — `designer/storage.py` and `designer/history.py` tighten snapshot handling and Windows-safe atomic writes
- **Prompt scaffolding** — `prompts.py`, `self_knowledge.py`, and `memory.py` feed richer identity, self-knowledge, and threads context into the agent
- **Installer packaging** — `installer/thoth_setup.iss` bumps to v3.17.0 and bundles the new Designer runtime assets and video-guide skills
- **Skills & guides** — `bundled_skills/design_creator/SKILL.md` and `tool_guides/designer_guide/SKILL.md` are rewritten around the five modes, typed image slots, and the critique-repair loop

### 🧪 Tests

- **Regression expansion** — `test_suite.py` picks up **~2,700 new lines** of coverage, heavily focused on Designer modes, runtime bridge, export isolation, image slot resolution, critique thresholds, and the video generation tool
- **Section 73: Auto-Update** — 16 dedicated tests covering the updater public API, config persistence, manifest parsing and SHA256 verification, per-platform asset selection, channel filtering and skip-list handling, state transitions, dev-install detection, and `thoth_check_for_updates` / `thoth_install_update` tool registration

## v3.16.0 — Designer Studio, Self-Aware Status & Insight Engine

Thoth gains a full **Designer Studio** for building multi-page presentations, one-pagers, marketing material, and reports inside the app. Designer ships with a home-screen gallery, unified setup flow, live editor, brand controls, reusable components, AI image generation, chart embedding, presenter mode, published deck links, and export to **PDF / HTML / PNG / PPTX**. Outside Designer, Thoth becomes more **self-aware** — a new **Thoth Status** tool can inspect live configuration, tools, channels, logs, and Designer state, **identity** is now configurable, and the dream cycle now produces actionable **insights** surfaced in the Workflow Console. The home UI gains a dedicated **Designer** tab, a new **status bar** with configurable avatar and live health pills, and extracted shared chat components used by both the main chat and Designer. Ships with major regression expansion, including dedicated coverage for Designer Studio, identity, self-knowledge, Thoth Status, and insights, bringing the suite to **1751 PASS / 0 FAIL / 4 WARN**.

### 🎨 Designer Studio

A complete in-app design subsystem for decks, one-pagers, reports, and marketing layouts.

- **New `designer/` subsystem** — gallery, setup flow, editor, preview, export, publish, presentation, history, references, storage, AI content, and brand modules across ~35 new files
- **Home-screen Designer tab** — `ui/home.py` adds a first-class Designer surface alongside Workflows, Knowledge, and Activity, with a project gallery and direct launch into the editor
- **Unified project setup flow** — template selection, aspect ratio / canvas sizing, project brief capture, and create-only vs create-and-build-first-draft flows are handled in one entry point instead of separate dialogs
- **Live multi-page editor** — page navigator, canvas resize controls, interactive preview editing, in-place text editing, undo/redo, and snapshot history support iterative design work without leaving the app
- **Brand system** — brand presets, color/font controls, logo placement, and brand-variable injection allow consistent styling across pages and exports
- **Reusable design blocks** — curated components, critique helpers, and deterministic repair flows support structured layout building and safe cleanup passes
- **AI-assisted content tools** — generate images, refine copy, add charts, generate notes, and update individual pages without rewriting whole projects
- **Presentation and sharing** — presenter mode, separate audience window support, publishable deck links, and export to PDF / HTML / PNG / PPTX complete the end-to-end workflow

### 🖼️ Asset-Backed Design Media

Designer media now uses persisted asset references instead of bloating project HTML with inline image payloads.

- **Canonical asset refs** — stored project HTML now uses `asset://<asset-id>` references for generated images, inserted images, replaced images, and charts
- **Persistent media storage** — Designer assets are stored on disk per project and hydrated for preview, export, publish, and presentation output when needed
- **Compatibility normalization** — render and load paths tolerate legacy data URIs, legacy `asset:` schemes, and malformed “asset-like” identifiers instead of failing hard or leaving broken placeholders
- **Compact project state** — `designer_get_project` and stored page HTML stay small and structured because binary image data no longer rides inside every page update
- **Windows-safe atomic writes** — project and asset persistence now use unique temp files plus replace retries for common Windows file-lock cases, avoiding temp-file races and placeholder-only failures

### 🪞 Self-Aware Status & Identity

Thoth can now inspect and describe its own state more accurately, and selected self-management actions are exposed through a dedicated tool.

- **New `thoth_status` tool** — query version, model, channels, memory, skills, tools, API keys, tasks, voice, image generation, video generation, config, logs, errors, and Designer project state from one place
- **Controlled self-management** — `thoth_update_setting` can change selected settings such as model, context caps, dream-cycle settings, tool toggles, skill toggles, image-generation model, video-generation model, and self-improvement mode with explicit approval
- **Identity module** — new `identity.py` persists assistant name and personality in user config, sanitizes prompt-injection-like text, and stores the self-improvement toggle
- **Dynamic prompt identity** — `prompts.py` now builds the agent system prompt from the configured identity instead of relying solely on the static fallback string
- **Self-improvement hooks** — Thoth Status can create new user skills and patch existing skills with backups and bundled-skill overrides when self-improvement is enabled
- **New tool guide** — `tool_guides/thoth_status_guide/SKILL.md` documents when to query status, when to inspect logs, and how controlled setting changes should be handled

### 🧠 Self-Knowledge, Memory & Insights

The agent now has a richer internal model of its own capabilities, and the dream cycle can turn system observations into actionable follow-up.

- **Self-knowledge manifest** — new `self_knowledge.py` defines a structured feature manifest, dynamic state block, and identity line so the agent can answer “what can you do?” more consistently
- **Designer and self-awareness prompting** — prompt scaffolding now includes self-knowledge and a dedicated `DREAM_INSIGHTS_PROMPT` for turning recent system activity into structured insight objects
- **Insights engine** — new `insights.py` persists, deduplicates, prunes, pins, dismisses, and applies insights across categories including error patterns, skill proposals, tool configuration, knowledge quality, usage patterns, and system health
- **Workflow Console integration** — `ui/command_center.py` adds an Insights panel with dismiss, pin, investigate, and apply actions, including one-click application of auto-fixable skill proposals
- **Richer memory / graph metadata** — memory extraction and knowledge-graph flows now support aliases, source metadata, stronger relation handling, and updated self-knowledge integration

### 💬 UI & Workflow Updates

- **Shared chat primitives** — new `ui/chat_components.py` extracts the chat message area, upload flow, and input bar into reusable components shared by the main chat and Designer
- **Status bar overhaul** — `ui/status_bar.py` replaces the old home logo section with a configurable avatar, cached health pills, and a diagnosis button wired into `ui/status_checks.py`
- **Dynamic health checks** — status checks now cover model availability, cloud APIs, channels, tunnel state, scheduler status, memory extraction freshness, and OAuth-backed tools with consistent `CheckResult` handling
- **Settings wiring** — settings now expose identity configuration and related persistence instead of treating the assistant name/personality as static
- **Design workflow guidance** — new bundled `design_creator` skill plus the Designer tool guide help steer presentation and layout workflows more consistently

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Designer image placeholders** — preview and editor rendering now correctly hydrate persisted Designer image assets instead of leaving placeholder-only image blocks when stored HTML contains non-canonical asset references
- **Gallery preview accuracy** — Designer gallery cards load the real current first-page content instead of relying on stale summary HTML
- **Atomic save collisions on Windows** — overlapping project saves no longer collide on a shared temp path; unique temp files and replace retries handle common `WinError 2`, `WinError 5`, and `WinError 32` cases more safely
- **Graceful legacy asset handling** — malformed legacy base64 payloads, invalid legacy logo data, and unresolved legacy asset refs degrade safely instead of breaking the whole project render path

### 🔧 Other Changes

- **Tool registration** — `tools/__init__.py` now registers both the new Thoth Status tool and the Designer tool on startup
- **Local presentation assets** — `static/reveal/` and `static/fonts/` add self-hosted presentation/runtime assets for Designer export and presentation flows
- **Version single source of truth** — new `version.py` centralizes the app version string for reuse across the app and tools
- **Installer / packaging updates** — installer and requirements changes pull the new Designer and self-awareness surfaces into the packaged app

### 🧪 Tests

- **Dedicated Designer coverage** — `test_suite.py` adds Section 72 for Designer Studio, covering imports, setup flow, component rendering, storage, prompt building, preview, export, tool registration, and asset-backed media behavior
- **Self-awareness coverage** — new tests cover `identity.py`, `self_knowledge.py`, `tools/thoth_status_tool.py`, and `insights.py`, including prompt injection sanitization, status categories, insight CRUD, and semantic deduplication
- **Designer E2E plan** — `docs/DESIGNER_E2E_TEST.md` documents the manual end-to-end validation path for gallery, editor, branding, AI content, export, and presenter mode
- **Regression expansion** — the combined suite now validates the new Designer, self-awareness, and insights surfaces end to end, reaching **1751 PASS / 0 FAIL / 4 WARN**

## v3.15.0 — Multi-Channel Messaging, X Tool, Tunnels & Tool Guides

Thoth goes **multi-channel** — four new messaging adapters join Telegram: **WhatsApp** (via Baileys bridge with QR pairing), **Discord**, **Slack**, and **SMS** (Twilio). All five channels share full parity: streaming responses, typing indicators, reactions, media capture, slash commands, and thread management. A new **tunnel manager** (ngrok) auto-exposes webhook ports so channels like SMS receive inbound messages without manual port forwarding. The **X (Twitter) tool** adds native read, post, and engagement capabilities via OAuth 2.0 PKCE. A **tool guides** system auto-injects per-tool usage instructions into the system prompt when tools are enabled, replacing 120+ lines of hardcoded prompt text. The **sidebar** gains a live **channel health monitor** with status dots, icons, and last-activity tracking. A **chat input redesign** wraps the composer in a modern card layout. Generated images now **persist to disk** so channels can send them after generation. Ships with **~76 net new tests** across 3 sections, covering the X tool, finish-reason detection, and tunnel infrastructure.

### 📡 Multi-Channel Messaging

Four new channel adapters give Thoth the same conversational experience across five platforms.

- **WhatsApp** — Node.js bridge powered by Baileys v6 with QR code pairing (displayed in Settings); inbound/outbound text, photos, documents, and voice; YouTube URL extraction with rich link previews via oEmbed + thumbnail fetch; Markdown-to-WhatsApp formatting with table conversion; streaming responses via rate-limited message edits; typing indicators and emoji reactions
- **Discord** — `discord.py` adapter with DM-based messaging; OAuth bot token authentication with numeric User ID gating; streaming via message edits; reactions, typing, slash commands, and media support
- **Slack** — `slack-bolt` adapter with Socket Mode for zero-webhook operation; DM threading; streaming responses via `chat.update`; reactions, typing, and file uploads
- **SMS** — Twilio adapter with inbound webhook receiver; outbound via Twilio REST API; MMS photo support; requires tunnel for inbound delivery
- **Channel parity** — all 5 channels share media capture helpers (`channels/media_capture.py`), auth utilities (`channels/auth.py`), slash command handling (`channels/commands.py`), corrupt-thread detection (`channels/thread_repair.py`), approval routing (`channels/approval.py`), and YouTube URL extraction (`channels/__init__.py`)
- **Auto-start** — each channel has an `auto_start` config flag; `app.py` imports all five adapters at startup and starts configured channels automatically
- **Channel tool factory** — `channels/tool_factory.py` delegates target resolution to each channel's `get_default_target()` method, replacing hardcoded Telegram-only logic; running channels auto-inject their send/photo/document tools into the agent graph

### 🔗 Tunnel Manager

A provider-agnostic tunnel infrastructure for exposing local webhook ports to the internet.

- **`tunnel.py`** — `TunnelProvider` ABC with `NgrokProvider` implementation using `pyngrok`; thread-safe `TunnelManager` singleton
- **Auto-lifecycle** — channels call `tunnel_manager.start_tunnel(port)` on start and `stop_tunnel(port)` on shutdown; orphaned ngrok processes killed at app startup via `kill_stale_ngrok()`
- **Settings UI** — Tunnel Settings section in the Channels tab with provider picker (ngrok), auth token input, active tunnel display, and optional main-app tunnel toggle
- **Health check** — `check_tunnel()` in `status_checks.py` reports active tunnel count and URLs

### 🐦 X (Twitter) Tool

Native X API v2 integration with OAuth 2.0 PKCE authentication — no external CLI or tweepy dependency.

- **13 tools** — `x_get_timeline`, `x_get_user_tweets`, `x_search`, `x_get_tweet`, `x_post_tweet`, `x_reply`, `x_retweet`, `x_like`, `x_unlike`, `x_get_mentions`, `x_get_followers`, `x_get_following`, `x_get_user`
- **OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow** — browser-based authorization with local HTTP callback server; token persistence and auto-refresh; tier detection (Free/Basic/Pro) with endpoint gating
- **Rate limiting** — per-endpoint rate limit tracking with automatic backoff and retry
- **Settings UI** — Accounts tab with X (Twitter) panel showing connection status, API key configuration with step-by-step setup guide, and Connect/Disconnect buttons

### 📘 Tool Guides

A new skill category that auto-injects per-tool usage instructions into the system prompt.

- **`tool_guides/` directory** — 13 SKILL.md files (browser, calendar, chart, email, filesystem, math, shell, telegram, tracker, vision, weather, wiki, x) containing focused tool-usage instructions
- **`tools` field in SKILL.md** — skills can now declare linked tools; when any linked tool is enabled, the guide auto-activates without manual toggling
- **Prompt cleanup** — 120+ lines of hardcoded tool instructions removed from `AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `prompts.py`; replaced by dynamically-injected tool guides that only appear when relevant tools are enabled
- **UI separation** — `get_manual_skills()` returns only user-created skills for the Settings Skills tab; tool guides are hidden from manual toggle but always active when their tools are on
- **Skill editor** — new "Linked Tools" multi-select field with chip display for creating tool-linked skills

### 📊 Sidebar Channel Monitor

A live channel health panel in the sidebar, replacing the status bar channel pills.

- **Channel monitor panel** — renders below the conversation list with status dots (green = running, amber = stopped, grey = not configured), channel-specific icons, display names, and relative last-activity times ("2m ago", "1h ago")
- **Activity tracker** — `channels/base.py` tracks `record_activity()` / `get_last_activity()` per channel; all 5 channel handlers call `record_activity()` on each inbound message
- **5-second polling** — `ui.timer(5.0)` refreshes the panel; click any row to open Settings
- **Status bar cleanup** — channel pills filtered from `_render_pills()` in `ui/status_bar.py`; channel health checks remain in the diagnosis dialog

### 💬 Chat Input Redesign

The chat composer is modernized with a card-based layout.

- **Rounded card** — input wrapped in a styled column with `border-radius: 18px`, subtle border, and translucent background
- **File chips inside card** — attached file chips render inside the input card instead of a separate row above
- **Auto-scroll fix** — `wheel`/`touchstart` timestamp tracking prevents the MutationObserver feedback loop on Mac WKWebView that caused auto-scroll to fight user scrolling

### 🖥️ Native App Improvements

- **External link handling** — links in chat now open in the system browser instead of navigating in-app; in pywebview mode, routes through `JsApi.open_url()` via `window.pywebview.api`
- **Context menu paste fix** — right-click Paste now correctly focuses the target element before inserting text; fallback to `document.execCommand('paste')` on clipboard API failure
- **Viewport lock** — `html, body { overflow: hidden }` prevents page-level scrolling in the native window
- **Layout padding** — bottom padding added to prevent chat input from touching the window edge

### 🖼️ Image Persistence to Disk

Generated and edited images now persist to the per-thread media directory.

- **`_save_image_to_disk()`** — saves base64 image data to `~/.thoth/media/{thread_id}/gen_NNN.png` (or `edit_NNN.png`) using the existing media pipeline from `threads.py`
- **All providers** — OpenAI, xAI, and Google image gen/edit paths now call `_save_image_to_disk()` after generation; the saved path is included in the tool result so channels can reference it for sending photos
- **Received files** — `channels/media.py` gains `copy_to_workspace()` to copy inbound attachments into the filesystem-tool workspace (`Received Files/`) with dedup

### ⚡ Streaming on Telegram

Telegram responses now stream live instead of waiting for the full answer.

- **Placeholder + edit pattern** — sends a "⏳" placeholder message, then progressively edits it with accumulated tokens and tool status lines
- **Rate-limited edits** — `_tg_edit_consumer()` edits at most every 1.5 seconds to respect Telegram API rate limits; uses a `queue.Queue` bridge between the sync agent executor and the async Telegram event loop
- **Overflow protection** — if the accumulated text exceeds `MAX_TG_MESSAGE_LEN`, streaming stops editing and the final response is sent as a fresh split message

### ⚠️ Finish-Reason Detection

- **`_finish_reason` tracking** — `_stream_graph()` now reads `response_metadata.finish_reason` from each streaming chunk
- **Truncation warning** — when `finish_reason == "length"`, appends a user-visible warning: "⚠️ This response was cut short by the model's output token limit"

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **YouTube Shorts URLs** — `youtube.com/shorts/` pattern added to all 3 Python regexes (`channels/__init__.py`, `ui/render.py`, `ui/constants.py`) and the bridge; previously Shorts links were silently dropped
- **Thread ordering** — WhatsApp and Discord `_get_or_create_thread` now always call `_save_thread_meta`, not just for new threads; conversations correctly reorder by last message in the sidebar
- **Channel thread icons** — WhatsApp (📲 / `forum`), Discord (🎮 / `sports_esports`), and SMS (`textsms`) threads show correct icons in the sidebar
- **Sidebar thread limit** — `SIDEBAR_MAX_THREADS` bumped from 8 to 10
- **OAuth token message** — "re-authenticate in Settings → Google" corrected to "Settings → Accounts"
- **Search tools filter** — Settings → Search & Knowledge now uses an allowlist (`web_search`, `duckduckgo`, `wolfram_alpha`, `arxiv`, `wikipedia`, `youtube`) instead of a blocklist, preventing new tools from being silently hidden

### 🔧 Other Changes

- **Settings → Accounts tab** — Google Account panel refactored into `_build_google_account_panel()` with live status text; new X (Twitter) panel with OAuth flow and tier detection
- **Settings → Channels tab** — dynamic `_build_channel_panel(ch)` renders auto-generated config UI for any registered channel using `config_fields`; tunnel settings section
- **Channel `webhook_port` / `needs_tunnel`** — new properties on `Channel` ABC for channels that need inbound webhooks
- **Channel `get_default_target()`** — new method on `Channel` ABC; replaces hardcoded Telegram-only target resolution in tool factory
- **`check_channels()` returns list** — `run_all_checks()` and `run_light_checks()` now handle list-returning check functions via `isinstance(result, list)` flattening
- **Deleted `tools/telegram_tool.py`** — 244 lines removed; Telegram send/photo/document tools now generated dynamically by the channel tool factory
- **Requirements** — 5 new dependencies (`slack-bolt`, `twilio`, `discord.py`, `pyngrok`, `qrcode`)

### 🧪 Tests

- **~76 net new tests** across 3 new sections (65–67), updating and expanding existing sections
- **Section 65: X (Twitter) Tool** — OAuth token management, API tier detection, tool registration, rate limiting, Settings Accounts tab with X section
- **Section 66: Streaming Finish-Reason Detection** — `_finish_reason` tracking in `_stream_graph`, truncation warning injection, `response_metadata` parsing
- **Section 67: Tunnel & Webhook Infrastructure** — `tunnel.py` module structure, `TunnelManager` singleton, ngrok provider, Settings tunnel section, channel `needs_tunnel` / `webhook_port` properties
- **Existing section updates** — removed obsolete Telegram-specific prompt tests (TELEGRAM MESSAGING, EMAIL ATTACHMENTS sections moved to tool guides); updated approval channel tests

## v3.14.0 — Multi-Provider Cloud, xAI Integration, Workflow Console & UI Polish

Thoth becomes truly **multi-provider** — Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), and xAI (Grok) join OpenAI and OpenRouter as first-class cloud providers with key validation, model fetching, and live model pickers. **Image generation** expands to xAI's Grok Imagine and Google's Imagen 4 / Nano Banana families. A new **media storage architecture** replaces in-memory base64 with file-on-disk persistence and two-tier cleanup, laying the foundation for video generation. A new **Workflow Console** replaces the right drawer with a professional operations panel. The **terminal architecture** is refactored into a modular PTY bridge. **Prompt-injection defences** add 5-layer scanning. The UI receives a polish pass — auto-scroll, inline image rendering fixes, and sidebar refinements. Ships with **172 new tests** across 4 sections, bringing the total to **1526 PASS**, 0 FAIL, 3 WARN.

### ☁️ Multi-Provider Cloud Support

Anthropic, Google AI, and xAI are now first-class cloud providers alongside OpenAI and OpenRouter.

- **Anthropic (Claude)** — API key configuration, validation via `/v1/models`, paginated model fetching with `after_id`, context size from `max_input_tokens`, skip list for non-chat models (embed, tokenizer)
- **Google (Gemini)** — API key configuration, validation via Generative Language API, model fetching with pagination, skip list for non-chat models (embed, aqa, imagen, veo, tts)
- **xAI (Grok)** — API key configuration, validation via `/v1/language-models`, model fetching, Grok 4/3/2 context-size catalog (up to 2M tokens), non-chat model filtering (image/video generation models excluded from chat picker)
- **Provider-aware UI** — cloud status banner shows provider name and emoji (⬡ OpenAI, 💎 Google, 𝕏 xAI); `is_cloud_model()` expanded to detect all providers; model picker refreshes all configured providers
- **LLM instantiation** — `ChatAnthropic`, `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`, and `ChatXAI` LangChain adapters with proper API key injection

### 🎨 Image Generation — xAI & Google Expansion

Image generation gains two new provider families and architectural improvements.

- **xAI Grok Imagine** — `grok-imagine-image` model with aspect ratio and resolution mapping; quality-to-resolution conversion (`low` → 1k, `high` → 2k)
- **Google Nano Banana** — `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview`, `gemini-3-pro-image-preview`, `gemini-2.5-flash-image` via `generate_content` API with `response_modalities=['IMAGE']`; supports both generation and editing
- **Google Imagen 4** — `imagen-4.0-generate-001`, `imagen-4.0-fast-generate-001`, `imagen-4.0-ultra-generate-001` via dedicated `generate_images` API; generation only
- **Per-provider model picker** — Settings → Models shows only models for providers with configured API keys
- **Image cache preservation** — cached images now persist within the same thread across turns (no longer cleared on each message); only cleared on thread switch

### 🖥️ Workflow Console

The right drawer is redesigned as a professional operations panel.

- **Workflow Console** — renamed from "Workflows Command Center"; heading with "Background Agents" subtitle
- **5-section layout** — Running (with live progress bars and log), Approvals, Upcoming, Quick Launch (dropdown + Run / + New), Recent Runs
- **Auto-refresh** — 3-second timer syncs the workflow dropdown with running state
- **440px drawer width** — widened from 380px for comfortable content display

### 🖥️ Terminal Architecture

A modular terminal backend replacing inline shell rendering.

- **`terminal_bridge.py`** — PTY communication bridge between the UI and system shell
- **`terminal_pty.py`** — portable PTY backend with process lifecycle management
- **`ui/terminal_widget.py`** — NiceGUI terminal widget with scroll area and command history
- **Terminal panel removal** — the old inline terminal rendering block in `_handle_tool_done` is removed; shell output now shows in the standard tool expansion

### 🛡️ Prompt-Injection Defence

5-layer scanning protects against prompt injection attacks in tool outputs and user inputs.

- **Layer 1: Instruction override detection** — catches "ignore previous instructions", "you are now", "new system prompt" patterns
- **Layer 2: Role impersonation** — detects attempts to impersonate system, assistant, or admin roles
- **Layer 3: Data exfiltration** — flags suspicious URLs with long query strings, base64 segments, or encoded credentials
- **Layer 4: Encoding evasion** — detects base64-encoded instruction overrides and Unicode homoglyph substitution
- **Layer 5: Social engineering** — catches urgency phrases, authority claims, and compliance pressure

### 🔄 Auto-Scroll

Chat window auto-scroll now works reliably using a client-side MutationObserver pattern.

- **Default ON** — chat auto-scrolls to the bottom as tokens stream in
- **User override** — scrolling up more than 50px from the bottom disables auto-scroll; it stays where you put it
- **Auto-reset** — sending a new message or starting a new generation re-engages auto-scroll
- **Client-side only** — no Python round-trips; MutationObserver watches DOM changes and scrolls via native `scrollTop`, matching the pattern used by NiceGUI's own `ui.log` component

### � Media Storage Architecture

A new file-on-disk media system replaces the old in-memory base64 approach, unifying image and future video storage with two-tier persistence.

- **File-on-disk storage** — all media (generated images, captures, attachments) saved to `~/.thoth/media/{thread_id}/` with sequential filenames (`gen_001.png`, `cap_002.png`); sidecar `.media.json` tracks entries per message with type, path, and persist flag
- **Sidecar format v2** — `{version: 2, entries: [{idx, role, sig, media: [{type, path, persist}]}]}` replaces old `.images.json`; clean cut with no backward-compatibility code
- **Two-tier persistence** — Tier 1 (generated content: image gen, video gen, plugin output) survives thread deletion; Tier 2 (captures: vision, browser, filesystem, attachments) cleaned up with thread
- **Thread deletion cleanup** — deletes sidecar + Tier 2 files; preserves Tier 1 files on disk; removes empty media directories
- **6 image sources tagged** — Image Gen Tool (Tier 1), Vision Tool (Tier 2), Browser Tool (Tier 2), Filesystem Tool (Tier 2), Plugin `__IMAGE__` (Tier 1), User Attachments (Tier 2)
- **Hydration on thread load** — `_hydrate_thread_media()` reads files from disk and converts to base64 for display; replaces old in-memory-only approach

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Inline image rendering** — `_handle_tool_done` now extracts `raw_name` from tool-done events and uses it for all tool identity checks (`generate_image`, `edit_image`, `browser_*`, `workspace_read_file`, `analyze_image`); previously these compared display names against raw function names and never matched, so generated images, browser screenshots, vision captures, and filesystem images were never rendered inline
- **Workflow "(paused)" label** — `_resume_pipeline()` and `_resume_graph_interrupted()` now strip the "(paused)" suffix from thread names on resume

### 🔧 Other Changes

- **Persistent logging** — `logging_config.py` with centralized configuration; Settings → Logging section with level picker and Open Folder button; Activity panel "Recent Logs" section
- **Knowledge graph entity editor** — `ui/entity_editor.py` for inline entity editing in the graph panel
- **Wiki vault expansion** — +213 lines of vault management improvements
- **Dream cycle tuning** — additional quality fixes validated by new test section
- **Sidebar polish** — wave hand icon shrunk (1.4 → 1.1rem), gear icon enlarged (1.25rem) and converted to icon-only round button; "Settings" text label removed
- **"Workflows Running"** — sidebar avatar badge renamed from "Tasks Running"
- **"No workflows running"** — empty-state placeholder renamed in Workflow Console
- **Browser tool** — +36 lines of browser automation additions
- **Memory tool** — +70 lines of memory operations
- **Shell tool** — +39 lines of safety classification improvements
- **Task tool** — persistent thread support in tool schemas
- **Requirements** — 6 new dependencies (`langchain-anthropic`, `langchain-google-genai`, `langchain-xai`, and others)

### 🧪 Tests

- **172 new tests** across 4 sections (50–51, 52 expansion, 57), bringing the total to **1526 PASS**, 0 FAIL, 3 WARN
- **Section 50: Prompt-Injection Defence** — 5-layer scanning: instruction override, role impersonation, data exfiltration, encoding evasion, social engineering; clean text passthrough; warning format validation
- **Section 51: Persistent Logging** — logging config, level picker, file handler, Settings UI section, Activity panel Recent Logs section
- **Section 52 expansion** — xAI provider, Google Imagen 4 + Nano Banana models, per-provider model registry, aspect ratio mapping, image cache thread preservation, key validation, model fetching
- **Section 57: Dream Cycle Tuning** — quality fix validations

## v3.13.0 — Advanced Workflows, Approval Gates & Memory Overhaul

Tasks evolve into **advanced workflows** with step-based pipelines, conditional branching, and approval gates. The **dream cycle** gets a comprehensive quality overhaul — hub diversity caps, batch rotation, rejection caching, confidence decay, and Ollama busy checks. **Memory extraction** gains vague-type banning, relation pre-normalisation, and cross-source merge protection. **Document extraction** is hardened with entity caps, description quality gates, self-loop rejection, and a curated relation vocabulary that eliminates 96% of unknown-type warnings. Ships with **221 new tests** across 3 sections, bringing the total to **1354 PASS**, 0 FAIL, 1 WARN.

### 🔀 Advanced Workflow Builder

Tasks are renamed to **Workflows** throughout the application and gain a full pipeline builder with branching logic.

- **Step-based pipelines** — 5 step types: Prompt, Condition, Approval, Subtask, and Notify; each step can reference previous step output via `{{step.X.output}}` variables
- **Conditional branching** — `if_true` / `if_false` routing with expression operators: contains, regex, JSON path, and LLM evaluation
- **Approval gates** — workflows pause at approval steps and wait for human decision; configurable timeout with `if_approved` / `if_denied` routing
- **Webhook triggers** — workflows can be triggered via `POST /api/webhook/<task_id>` with auto-generated secrets for authentication
- **Task-completion triggers** — one workflow can trigger another on completion, enabling chained automation
- **Concurrency groups** — prevent parallel execution of related workflows; only one workflow per group runs at a time
- **Safety mode** — per-workflow setting: block destructive tools, require approval on destructive, or allow all; enforced across shell, task, and channel tools
- **Tools override** — per-step tool selection with auto-detection from prompt content
- **Agent-callable** — the task tool now accepts step definitions, triggers, safety mode, and concurrency group for programmatic workflow creation

### 🏗️ Workflow Builder UI

A redesigned task dialog with simple and advanced modes.

- **Simple/Advanced toggle** — simple mode preserves the existing single-prompt interface; advanced mode exposes the full pipeline builder
- **Step builder** — drag-to-reorder, delete, type-change for each step; visual condition builder with operator picker, JSON path input, and LLM question textarea
- **Variable insertion menu** — `{{step.X.output}}`, `{{date}}`, `{{time}}`, and context variables insertable via dropdown
- **Flow preview** — Mermaid diagram generated from step graph with refresh button
- **Validation** — required field checks, reference validation, and operator-specific rules before save

### ✋ Approval Gates

Built-in pause/resume for human decisions on destructive or high-stakes actions.

- **Pending approvals panel** — Activity tab shows pending approval cards with task name, message, and Approve / Deny buttons; auto-refreshes every 5 seconds
- **Sidebar badge** — orange count badge on the Home button when approvals are pending; compact approval strip above the thread list with quick-approve buttons
- **Multi-channel routing** — approval requests sent to configured channels (Telegram, desktop notifications) with inline keyboard buttons
- **Agent integration** — agent checks pending approvals before resuming; routes to `if_approved` or `if_denied` step based on user response

### 🧠 Dream Cycle Quality Overhaul

A comprehensive quality improvement to the dream inference engine, validated across three 5-cycle test rounds.

- **Hub diversity cap** — limits any single entity to at most 3 appearances across inferred pairs per cycle, preventing popular entities from monopolising inferences
- **Batch rotation** — stored offset with half-overlap ensures fresh entity pairs each cycle instead of re-evaluating the same 50 oldest entities
- **Rejection cache** — pairs rejected by the LLM are cached for 7 days in `dream_rejections.json`; avoids wasting LLM calls on previously rejected combinations
- **Pre-flight merge check** — before inferring a relation between entities A and B, checks if A's description already mentions B's subject (likely already merged); skips if so
- **Skip vague edges** — dream inference skips existing vague relation types (`related_to`, `associated_with`, etc.) when checking for existing connections
- **Multi-excerpt evidence** — inference prompt now receives multiple conversation excerpts per entity pair for richer context
- **Confidence decay** — new Phase 3 in the dream cycle: relations older than 90 days lose 10% confidence per cycle; relations below 0.3 are pruned automatically
- **Ollama busy check** — queries `/api/ps` before starting a dream cycle; defers if Ollama is actively serving a user request to avoid GPU competition
- **`uses` prompt tightening** — rule 6 in the inference prompt: "`uses` means actively employs as a tool, dependency, or platform — NOT merely mentions, searches for, or discusses"
- **🌙 Dream button** — manual dream cycle trigger in the graph panel; async execution with status notifications

### 🔬 Memory Extraction Hardening

Improvements to the background conversation extraction pipeline.

- **Vague-type ban** — `related_to`, `associated_with`, `connected_to`, `linked_to`, `has_relation`, `involves`, and `correlates_with` are rejected before saving, preventing noisy low-value edges
- **Relation pre-normalisation** — `normalize_relation_type()` is called before any checks (ban, confidence gate), ensuring aliases like `is_father_of` are canonicalised to `father_of` before evaluation
- **Cross-source merge protection** — when a document entity matches a personal entity via FAISS semantic search, the similarity threshold is raised from 0.80 to 0.90 to prevent impersonal document content from overwriting personal memories

### 📄 Document Extraction Improvements

Quality gates and relation vocabulary cleanup for the document map-reduce pipeline, validated by extracting 5 representative test documents (research paper, architecture doc, meeting notes, product spec, book chapter).

- **Curated relation vocabulary** — 6 new types added to `VALID_RELATION_TYPES`: `extracted_from`, `uploaded`, `builds_on`, `cites`, `extends`, `contradicts`; 4 alias mappings: `published_by → authored`, `implements → uses`, `used_by → uses`, `references → cites`; eliminates 96% of unknown-type warnings in existing document data
- **Prompt cleanup** — `DOC_EXTRACT_PROMPT` no longer suggests banned types (`related_to`, `associated_with`) or direction-confusing types (`used_by`); replaced with valid alternatives; confidence floor aligned from 0.5 to 0.6
- **Hub entity dedup** — `extract_from_document` checks for an existing media entity with `find_by_subject` before creating a new one; updates the existing hub on re-upload instead of creating a duplicate
- **Entity cap** — extracted entities capped at 12 per document; prevents LLM over-extraction on long documents
- **Min description length** — entities with descriptions shorter than 30 characters are rejected as thin stubs
- **Self-loop rejection** — `add_relation()` now blocks relations where source and target are the same entity (e.g. `Autonomous Agents → used_by → Autonomous Agents`)

### 🔧 Other Changes

- **Workflows rename** — "Tasks" renamed to "Workflows" throughout the UI (sidebar, home page, dialogs)
- **Web search tool** — replaced LangChain TavilySearchResults wrapper with direct TavilyClient API calls for faster execution
- **Shell tool safety** — enhanced destructive-command detection for safety-mode enforcement in workflows
- **Streaming robustness** — replaced silent exception swallowing with `logger.debug()` calls; pending tools tracked via dict instead of DOM search; Mermaid rendering uses `suppressErrors: true`
- **Compression mode** — removed "Smart" option; now "Off (default)" and "Deep (LLM)" only
- **Dream window picker** — interactive HH:00 time inputs for configuring the dream schedule
- **Extraction journal** — viewer button in Activity tab showing detailed extraction stats per thread
- **Dream journal** — expandable entries showing merges, enrichments, inferred relations, and errors per cycle
- **Graph panel** — "Show All" restyled as button; dream button added
- **Mac installer** — test files (`test_suite.py`, `test_memory_e2e.py`, `integration_tests.py`) and dev scripts (`_*.py`) excluded from build

### 🧪 Tests

- **221 new tests** across 3 sections (48–49), bringing the total to **1354 PASS**, 0 FAIL, 1 WARN
- **Section 48: Dream Cycle & Extraction Improvements** (13 tests, 48a–48am) — extraction vague-type rejection, extraction pre-normalisation, pre-flight merge check, `uses` prompt tightening, dream button in graph panel, Ollama busy check, confidence decay
- **Section 49: Document Extraction Improvements** (13 tests, 49a–49m) — document relation types in `VALID_RELATION_TYPES`, alias mappings, normalisation, self-loop rejection, prompt cleanup, hub entity dedup, entity cap, min description length, cross-source merge threshold, functional self-loop test, cross-window dedup merge test
- **5-document extraction verification** — research paper, architecture doc, meeting notes, product spec, book chapter; 49 entities, 101 relations, 0 unknown types, 0 self-loops, 0 banned types, 0 thin descriptions (perfect score)

## v3.12.0 — Plugin System, Multi-Channel Architecture & Image Generation

Thoth gains a full **plugin architecture** with a built-in **marketplace**, a **multi-channel messaging framework** that abstracts Telegram behind a generic Channel ABC (ready for Slack, Discord, and more), a complete **Telegram upgrade** with voice transcription, photo analysis, document extraction, and emoji reactions, an **image generation tool** powered by OpenAI/OpenRouter, a **Google Account setup wizard**, and expanded **task delivery** to any channel. Ships with **168 new tests** across 8 sections, bringing the total to **1133 PASS**, 0 FAIL, 2 WARN.

### 🔌 Plugin Architecture

A self-contained plugin runtime in `plugins/` handles the full lifecycle — discovery, validation, sandboxing, loading, and teardown.

- **Plugin API** — `PluginAPI` bridge object and `PluginTool` base class are the only core imports a plugin needs; provides `get_config()`, `set_config()`, `get_secret()`, `set_secret()`, `register_tool()`, `register_skill()`
- **Manifest system** — each plugin declares metadata in `plugin.json`: ID, version, author, description, tools, skills, settings schema, API keys, and Python dependencies; validated against a strict schema (ID regex, semver, required fields)
- **Security sandbox** — static scan blocks `eval()`, `exec()`, `os.system()`, `subprocess`, and `__import__()`; import guard prevents loading from core modules (`tools`, `agent`, `models`, `ui`); `register()` call has a 5-second timeout
- **Dependency safety** — freezes core dependency versions before installing plugin deps; blocks downgrades that could break Thoth
- **State persistence** — enable/disable state and config values are stored in `plugin_state.json`; plugin API-key secrets use the OS credential store with metadata in `plugin_secrets.json` under `~/.thoth/`
- **Hot reload** — "Reload Plugins" button in Settings clears the registry and re-runs discovery without restarting the app; agent cache is invalidated automatically
- **Skill auto-discovery** — `SKILL.md` files in a plugin's `skills/` directory are detected and injected into the agent's system prompt alongside built-in skills
- **Version gating** — plugins declare `min_thoth_version`; loader rejects incompatible plugins with a clear error message

### 🏪 Plugin Marketplace

A browse-and-install marketplace powered by a GitHub-hosted `index.json` catalog.

- **Marketplace client** — fetches and caches the plugin index with TTL-based refresh; provides search, tag filtering, and update detection
- **Browse dialog** — NiceGUI dialog with search bar, tag filter pills, and one-click install buttons
- **Install/update/uninstall** — downloads plugin archives, validates before install, manages `~/.thoth/installed_plugins/`; duplicate installs rejected; security violations block installation
- **Update detection** — `check_updates()` compares installed versions against the marketplace index

### ⚙️ Plugin Settings UI

A dedicated **Plugins** tab in Settings for managing all installed plugins.

- **Card grid** — each plugin rendered as a card with icon, name, version badge, description, tool/skill count badges, and enable/disable toggle
- **Missing API key warnings** — cards show a warning badge when required secrets are not configured
- **Per-plugin config dialog** — opens plugin details with API key inputs, settings controls, tools/skills list, and actions (update, uninstall)
- **Empty state** — "No plugins installed" with a marketplace call-to-action

### 🔗 Plugin API v2

Plugin tools gain richer return types and safety metadata.

- **`_run()` method** — plugins can now override `_run()` instead of `execute()` for a cleaner interface; base class handles argument parsing and error wrapping
- **`background_allowed` flag** — plugin tools declare whether they are safe to run in background task workflows; defaults to `False`
- **`destructive` flag** — marks tools that perform irreversible actions; gated from background execution unless explicitly allowed
- **Rich returns** — tool results can include structured data (dicts, lists) that the agent interprets contextually

### 🖼️ Image Generation Tool

Generate and edit images via OpenAI/OpenRouter, rendered inline in chat.

- **`generate_image`** — creates images from text prompts; supports `gpt-image-1`, `gpt-image-1.5`, `gpt-image-1-mini` models with configurable size and quality
- **`edit_image`** — modifies existing images; sources: `"last"` (most recent generation), filename (from attachment cache), or file path on disk
- **Side-channel rendering** — `_last_generated_image` passed to UI streaming layer for inline display; cleared after use
- **Attachment cache** — pasted/attached images stored in `_image_cache` (populated by `ui/streaming.py`) so the agent can reference them by filename
- **Model selector** — configurable in Settings → Models; default `openai/gpt-image-1.5`

### 📡 Channel Architecture (Multi-Channel Foundation)

A generic channel abstraction that decouples messaging from any single platform.

- **`Channel` ABC** — abstract base class all channel adapters inherit from; lifecycle methods `start()`, `stop()`, `is_configured()`, `is_running()`; outbound methods `send_message()`, `send_photo()`, `send_document()`, `send_approval_request()`
- **`ChannelCapabilities`** — declarative feature flags per channel (photo in/out, voice in, document in, buttons, streaming, reactions, slash commands); UI and tool factory read capabilities to auto-generate tooling
- **`ConfigField`** — describes user-configurable fields that render automatically in the Settings UI
- **Channel registry** — `register()`, `all_channels()`, `running_channels()`, `configured_channels()`; central routing via `deliver(channel_name, target, text)` with validation
- **Shared media pipeline** — `channels/media.py` provides `transcribe_audio()` (faster-whisper), `analyze_image()` (Vision service), `extract_document_text()` (PDF/CSV/JSON/plain-text), and `save_inbound_file()` — reusable by any channel
- **Tool factory** — `channels/tool_factory.py` auto-generates LangChain tools (`send_{name}_message`, `send_{name}_photo`, `send_{name}_document`) for each registered channel based on its capabilities; Pydantic input schemas; multi-strategy file path resolution
- **Channel config** — `channels/config.py` provides per-channel key-value store in `~/.thoth/channels_config.json`

### 📱 Telegram Upgrade

Telegram evolves from a basic text relay into a full-featured channel with rich media handling.

- **Voice messages** — inbound voice/audio transcribed via faster-whisper through the shared media pipeline; transcript sent to agent as user text
- **Photo messages** — inbound photos analyzed via Vision service; analysis sent to agent with optional caption
- **Document handling** — inbound documents saved to `~/.thoth/inbox/`, text extracted (PDF, CSV, JSON, plain text), file path + extracted content + caption sent to agent as one message
- **Image generation delivery** — `_grab_generated_image()` retrieves the last generated image from the image gen side-channel and sends it as a photo in Telegram
- **Emoji reactions** — real-time status feedback using Telegram's native reaction API: 👀 (processing), 👍 (success), 💔 (error); graceful fallback if bot lacks permission
- **Interrupt approval** — tool calls requiring human approval render as inline keyboard buttons in Telegram (Approve / Deny)
- **Auto-recovery** — handles orphaned tool calls gracefully; offers fresh thread on persistent failures
- **Bot commands** — registered with BotFather for discoverability

### 🔑 Google Account Setup Wizard

A unified setup flow for Google OAuth (Gmail + Calendar) in the Settings UI.

- **Step-by-step wizard** — guides users through creating OAuth credentials, downloading `credentials.json`, and completing the authorization flow
- **Token health checks** — periodic validation (every 6 hours) with silent refresh; desktop notifications on token expiry
- **Unified section** — Gmail and Calendar OAuth managed together under a single "Google Account" settings section

### 📋 Task System Enhancements

- **Delivery channels** — tasks can route results to Telegram (or future channels) via `delivery_channel` / `delivery_target` fields with validation
- **Model override** — per-task LLM selection via `model_override` field
- **Persistent threads** — `persistent_thread_id` reuses the same conversation thread across task runs
- **Notify-only mode** — `notify_only` flag fires a notification without agent invocation
- **Skills override** — `skills_override` for per-task skill selection
- **Schema migration** — new columns added to tasks table with automatic migration from old `workflows.db`

### 🔗 Core Integration

The plugin system and channel framework touch a minimal set of core files.

- **`app.py`** — calls `load_plugins()` at startup; auto-starts configured channels; periodic OAuth token health check (every 6 hours)
- **`agent.py`** — injects plugin tools + channel tools into the LangChain tools list; plugin skills into the system prompt; `clear_agent_cache()` exported for plugin/channel reload
- **`ui/settings.py`** — Plugins tab, marketplace dialog, Google Account wizard, channel configuration sections

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Telegram reactions not appearing** — 🔄/✅/❌ are not in Telegram's supported reaction set; swapped to 👀/👍/💔 which are supported natively
- **Image generation not shown in Telegram** — `_grab_generated_image()` now retrieves the side-channel image and sends it as a photo
- **"Tool limit reached" false message** — misleading error when tool calls completed normally; message removed
- **Document text extraction for Telegram** — inbound documents now have text extracted and included in the agent message
- **Plugin dependency install crash** — `install_dependencies()` returns `tuple[bool, str]` but installer called `.ok`/`.conflicts` on it; fixed with proper tuple unpacking
- **No auto-reload after marketplace install** — installed plugins now trigger full plugin reload + agent cache clear so tools are available immediately
- **Plugin tools not reaching agent after reload** — agent cache key only includes core tool names; `clear_agent_cache()` now called in both manual reload and marketplace install flows

## v3.11.0 — Wiki Vault, Dream Cycle, Document Extraction & Knowledge Consolidation

Three major knowledge systems land in this release. **Wiki Vault** exports the entire knowledge graph as an Obsidian-compatible markdown vault with YAML frontmatter, wiki-links, and per-type indexes. **Dream Cycle** runs nightly background refinement — merging duplicate entities, enriching thin descriptions from conversation context, and inferring missing relationships — with a three-layer anti-contamination system that prevents cross-entity fact-bleed. **Document Knowledge Extraction** processes uploaded documents through a map-reduce LLM pipeline, extracting entities and relations into the knowledge graph with full source provenance. The Settings UI consolidates all knowledge features under a unified **Knowledge tab**, the graph panel gains source filtering and recency glow, and the status bar grows to 17 health-check pills.

### 📚 Wiki Vault (Obsidian Export)

The knowledge graph can now be exported as a structured markdown vault, compatible with Obsidian, VS Code, and any markdown editor.

- **Vault structure** — entities grouped by type (`wiki/person/`, `wiki/project/`, `wiki/event/`, etc.) with one `.md` file per entity; sparse entities (<20 chars) roll up into `_index.md` per type; per-type indexes and a master `index.md` auto-generated on rebuild
- **YAML frontmatter** — each article includes `id`, `type`, `subject`, `aliases`, `tags`, `source`, `created`, `updated` metadata
- **Wiki-links** — related entities linked via `[[Entity Name]]` syntax, enabling Obsidian backlinks and graph view
- **Connections section** — outgoing and incoming relations listed with arrow notation
- **Live export** — entities are exported on save (≥20 chars), deleted on entity removal, and rebuilt on batch operations
- **Search** — full-text search across all `.md` files with title, snippet, and entity ID results
- **Conversation export** — any thread can be exported as a vault-compatible markdown file
- **Agent tool** — 5 sub-tools (`wiki_search`, `wiki_read`, `wiki_rebuild`, `wiki_stats`, `wiki_export_conversation`) let the agent interact with the vault
- **Settings UI** — enable/disable toggle, vault path configuration with Browse button, stats display, rebuild and open-folder buttons

### 🌙 Dream Cycle (Nightly Knowledge Refinement)

A background daemon refines the knowledge graph during idle hours, running three non-destructive operations.

- **Duplicate merge** — entities with ≥0.93 semantic similarity and same type are merged; LLM synthesizes the best description, aliases are unioned, relations re-pointed to the survivor
- **Description enrichment** — thin entities (<80 chars) appearing in 2+ conversations get richer descriptions from conversation context and relationship graph
- **Relationship inference** — co-occurring entity pairs with no existing edge are evaluated for a meaningful connection (tagged `source="dream_infer"`)
- **Three-layer anti-contamination** — (1) sentence-level excerpt filtering extracts only sentences mentioning the target entity, (2) deterministic post-enrichment cross-entity validation scans LLM output for unrelated entity subjects and rejects contaminated results before DB write, (3) strengthened prompt with concrete negative examples and subject-name substitution
- **Subject-name guard** — entities with different normalized subjects require ≥0.98 similarity to merge, preventing false merges of distinct people/concepts
- **Configurable window** — default 1–5 AM local time; checks every 30 minutes if conditions met (enabled, in window, idle, not yet run today)
- **Dream journal** — all operations logged to `~/.thoth/dream_journal.json` with cycle ID, summary, and duration; viewable in the Activity tab
- **Settings UI** — enable/disable toggle, window display, last run summary in the Knowledge tab
- **Status pill** — new Dream Cycle health-check pill shows enabled state and last run time

### 📄 Document Knowledge Extraction (Map-Reduce Pipeline)

Uploaded documents are now processed through a three-phase LLM pipeline that extracts structured knowledge.

- **Map phase** — document split into ~6K-char windows; each window summarized to 3–5 sentences
- **Reduce phase** — window summaries combined into a coherent 300–600 word article
- **Extract phase** — core entities and relations pulled from the final article; 3–8 entities per document
- **Hub entity** — the document itself is saved as a `media` entity; extracted entities linked via `extracted_from` relation for provenance
- **Cross-window dedup** — entities with the same subject across windows are merged before saving
- **Live progress** — status bar shows pulsing progress pill with phase indicator, progress bar, queue count, and stop button (updates every 2 seconds)
- **Background queue** — documents queued for processing; worker thread handles one at a time
- **New file formats** — document upload now supports `.md`, `.html`, and `.epub` in addition to PDF, DOCX, and TXT
- **Per-document cleanup** — individual document delete button removes vector store entries and all extracted entities with matching source tag; bulk "Clear all documents" removes everything with `document:*` prefix

### 🧠 Knowledge Tab Consolidation

All knowledge management features are unified under a single **Knowledge** settings tab.

- **Renamed** — "Memory" tab → "Knowledge" tab throughout settings, home Activity panel, and status pills
- **Unified sections** — Memory Extraction settings, Wiki Vault settings, Dream Cycle settings, and Danger Zone all in one place
- **Activity panel** — shows extraction counters (threads scanned, entities saved, islands repaired), Dream Cycle window/status/last run, and up to 3 recent dream journal entries
- **Danger zone** — "Delete all knowledge" now clears entities, vector store, and wiki vault folder in one operation with confirmation dialog

### 🕸️ Knowledge Graph Visualization Enhancements

The graph panel gains filtering tools and visual indicators for entity provenance and recency.

- **Source filter pills** — toggleable `💬 chat` and `📄 documents` buttons filter nodes by origin
- **Recency glow** — node border width and color reflect how recently the entity was updated: bright amber (≤7 days), orange (7–30 days), dim brown (30–90 days), stale grey (90+ days)
- **User hub toggle** — show or hide the central User node
- **Hide unlinked toggle** — hide entities connected only to the User node, revealing natural clusters
- **Source border style** — document-sourced entities render with dashed borders
- **Detail card** — now shows source label and recency (e.g., "📄 document · 1 day ago")
- **Edge IDs** — `graph_to_vis_json()` now includes `id` field on edges for stable updates

### 🔗 Memory Tool Improvements

- **Subject-name arguments** — `link_memories` and `explore_connections` now accept entity **names** (preferred) instead of hex IDs; `_resolve_entity()` helper looks up by name first, falls back to ID
- **Contradiction detection** — `save_memory` runs LLM-based contradiction check before updating; if a conflict is detected, the agent returns a warning and asks the user which version is correct
- **Cross-entity overwrite guard** — system prompt guardrail prevents `update_memory` from overwriting a memory belonging to a different subject than the one being discussed
- **Retry on parallel calls** — `link_memories` includes 0.5s retry delay for parallel tool invocations that race against entity creation

### 🔧 Rendering Fixes

- **Mermaid diagram extraction** — fenced mermaid blocks are now extracted from text *before* `markdown2` processing (which was mangling them), rendered as `<pre class="mermaid">` elements, and processed by `mermaid.js` with a 100ms post-render delay
- **Streaming finalization** — all streamed messages now get unconditionally re-rendered at finalization (was previously gated on YouTube/mermaid detection), fixing code block syntax highlighting that only appeared on refresh

### 📊 Status Monitor Updates

- **17 health-check pills** — 3 new checks for Dream Cycle, TTS (Kokoro), and Wiki Vault; total up from 14
- **Renamed** — "Memory" pill → "Knowledge" pill
- **Tab routing fixes** — Disk pill now links to System tab; FAISS Index pill no longer links anywhere (informational only)
- **Extraction progress pill** — live document extraction progress with phase, bar, queue count, and stop button

### 📋 Bundled Skills Updated

- **Knowledge Base** — new bundled skill guiding the agent through the unified knowledge system (graph + documents + wiki)
- **Self-Reflection** — updated to reference `wiki_search` and `wiki_rebuild` for the reflection cycle
- **Deep Research** — added "Check Existing Knowledge" and "Save Key Findings" steps
- **Brain Dump** — added "Check Existing Knowledge" step to prevent duplicating facts
- **Meeting Notes** — references knowledge graph and wiki linking
- **Tool fields removed** — `tools:` field removed from all updated skill frontmatters (skills auto-discover tools)

### 🧪 Tests

- **974 PASS**, 0 FAIL, 1 WARN (up from 886 in v3.10.0)
- New: Wiki Vault (74 tests), Auto-Recall improvements, Wiki Tool (5 sub-tools), Bundled Skills validation, Document Knowledge Extraction (map-reduce, dedup, queue, cleanup), Wiki Cleanup & Knowledge Tab consolidation, Dream Cycle (config, journal, safety checks, 14 assertions), Status monitor count updates

## v3.10.0 — Status Monitor, Mermaid Diagrams, Image Persistence, Vision Files & Rich PDF Export

The home screen gets an interactive **status monitor panel** — a frosted-glass bar with an animated avatar, 14 health-check pills, and a one-click diagnosis button. Images now **survive thread reload** — pasted, captured, and attached images are persisted in per-thread sidecar files and rehydrated when you revisit a conversation. **Mermaid diagram rendering** brings flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and state diagrams to life inline in chat via mermaid.js. The **vision tool** gains `source='file'` for analyzing workspace image files by path, and the **filesystem tool** displays images inline when read. **PDF export** is upgraded to Playwright (headless Chromium) for full Unicode, emoji, chart, and styled markdown support. **OAuth token health checks** proactively validate Gmail and Calendar tokens at startup with silent refresh and periodic re-validation. A rewritten **Arxiv tool**, **clipboard image paste**, **right-click context menu** (pywebview), and a knowledge graph **opacity-based filter** round out the release.

### 📊 Status Monitor Panel

- **Animated avatar** — customizable emoji with conic-gradient spinning ring, ECG-synced glow pulses, and subtle wobble; ring color picker with 15 presets; config persisted in `~/.thoth/user_config.json`
- **14 health-check pills** — two centered rows covering Ollama, Active Model, Cloud API, Email, Telegram, Gmail OAuth, Calendar OAuth, Task Scheduler, Memory Extraction, Disk Space, Threads DB, FAISS Index, Document Store, and Network; color-coded (green/amber/red/grey) with tooltip detail
- **Click-to-settings** — clicking any pill opens the relevant settings tab
- **Diagnosis button** — runs all 14 checks on demand (icon spins during execution), opens a dialog with expandable results per service and a copy-to-clipboard report
- **ECG background** — animated heart-rate-monitor line scrolls behind the frosted-glass panel
- **Light/heavy check split** — 4 instant checks (Ollama, Model, Cloud API, Memory Extraction) always fresh; 10 heavier checks (network, OAuth, disk, DB) cached for 5 minutes

### 🖼️ Image Persistence

Images in chat messages now survive thread reload and app restart.

- **Per-thread sidecar files** — image payloads (base64) are saved to `~/.thoth/thread_ui/<thread_id>.images.json` alongside conversation checkpoints
- **Signature-based hydration** — on reload, images are matched back to their messages using content signatures with index fallback for checkpoint-reconstructed user messages
- **All image types covered** — pasted images, vision captures, browser screenshots, and file attachments are all persisted
- **Cleanup on delete** — sidecar files are removed when a thread is deleted
- **MIME-aware data URIs** — PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP images are detected by magic bytes and rendered with the correct MIME type

### 📊 Mermaid Diagram Rendering

Mermaid diagrams now render as interactive visual diagrams inline in chat.

- **mermaid.js integration** — bundled `static/mermaid.min.js` loaded in head HTML with `securityLevel: 'strict'` and dark theme
- **Auto-fence detection** — `_auto_fence_mermaid()` in `ui/render.py` detects unfenced Mermaid syntax (graph, flowchart, sequenceDiagram, classDiagram, erDiagram, stateDiagram, gantt, mindmap, timeline, pie) and wraps it in ` ```mermaid ` fences before rendering
- **Streaming support** — `_format_assistant_markdown()` chains auto-fence + URL auto-linking on all streaming `set_content()` calls
- **Post-render swap** — after markdown rendering, `<pre><code class="language-mermaid">` blocks are swapped to `<div class="mermaid-rendered">` and processed by `mermaid.run()`
- **Chart tool guard** — requests for Mermaid diagram types (flow, sequence, state, ER, etc.) in `create_chart` are caught early with a helpful error message redirecting to fenced Mermaid blocks

### 👁️ Vision: Image File Analysis

The vision tool now analyzes image files in the workspace without needing a camera or screen capture.

- **`source='file'` parameter** — new source option on `analyze_image` with `file_path` argument for workspace-relative or absolute paths
- **Path resolution** — tries absolute path, then workspace root (from filesystem tool config), then current working directory
- **Prompt routing** — system prompt updated to guide the model: use `source='file'` for workspace images, don't re-analyze already-attached images
- **Filesystem inline display** — `workspace_read_file` on image files (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, TIFF, SVG) displays the image inline in chat and returns a hint to use `analyze_image` for content analysis

### 📄 Rich PDF Export

PDF export upgraded from basic fpdf2 text to full-fidelity Playwright rendering.

- **Playwright-first** — conversation export and `export_to_pdf` filesystem tool both use headless Chromium for full Unicode, emoji, embedded images, Plotly charts, styled markdown tables, and syntax-highlighted code blocks
- **Automatic fallback** — if Playwright is unavailable, falls back to the basic fpdf2 text-only renderer
- **Separate browser instance** — PDF rendering uses `headless=True` in a thread pool worker — does not interfere with the visible BrowserTool browser
- **Professional styling** — A4 layout, system fonts, color-coded roles (blue for User, gold for Thoth), collapsible tool-result blocks, responsive images

### 🔑 OAuth Token Health Checks

Gmail and Calendar OAuth tokens are now proactively monitored.

- **Startup check** — on launch, enabled Gmail/Calendar tools have their tokens validated; expired access tokens are silently refreshed
- **Periodic re-check** — APScheduler job runs every 6 hours to catch tokens that expire mid-session
- **Granular status** — `check_token_health()` on both tools returns `valid`, `refreshed`, `expired`, `missing`, or `error` with detail
- **Settings UI feedback** — Gmail and Calendar settings tabs show token status (healthy, refreshed, expired, error) instead of a generic "✅ Authenticated"
- **User-facing warnings** — expired tokens trigger desktop notifications and in-app toasts with re-authentication instructions

### 📚 Arxiv Tool Rewrite

The Arxiv tool is rewritten from scratch — no longer uses `ArxivRetriever`.

- **Direct `arxiv` package** — uses `arxiv.Client` with rate-limiting (`delay_seconds=3.0`) and retries
- **Newest-first sorting** — results sorted by `SubmittedDate` descending
- **Rich output** — title, authors (truncated at 5 with "et al."), published date, primary category, abstract, full-text HTML link, PDF link, and source URL per result
- **Version-stripped HTML URLs** — `arxiv.org/html/<id>` links strip the version suffix for clean access
- **Query syntax hints** — tool description mentions `ti:`, `au:`, `abs:`, `cat:` arXiv query syntax

### 📋 Clipboard Image Paste

- **Ctrl+V paste support** — paste images directly from the clipboard into chat; images are converted to file uploads with timestamped names (e.g. `pasted_image_1712345678.png`)
- **Singleton listener** — paste handler installs once and reads the dynamic upload widget ID, surviving thread switches without duplicate bindings

### 🖱️ Right-Click Context Menu (pywebview)

- **Custom context menu** — Cut, Copy, Paste, and Select All in the native desktop window, since pywebview suppresses the browser's default context menu
- **pywebview-only** — only activates inside pywebview; normal browsers keep their native context menu
- **Clipboard integration** — Paste reads from `navigator.clipboard` and inserts via `execCommand`

### 🕸️ Knowledge Graph Filter Overhaul

- **Opacity-based filtering** — search and entity-type filters now dim non-matching nodes/edges (opacity 0.12) instead of rebuilding the entire network, preserving layout stability and spatial context
- **Edge dimming** — edges between non-matching nodes fade to 0.06 opacity; edges connecting two matching nodes stay fully visible

### 🔧 Other Improvements

- **Immediate user message rendering** — file attachments are now processed asynchronously; the user message (with 📎 badges and image thumbnails) appears instantly while vision analysis runs in the background with a "🔍 Analyzing image..." indicator
- **Browser screenshot persistence** — browser screenshots taken during tool execution are added to `captured_images`, persisted via the image sidecar system, and restored on reload
- **Terminal chevron fix** — inline terminal panel expand/collapse chevron direction corrected (was inverted)
- **Drag-and-drop singleton** — drag-and-drop file handler installs once and reads the dynamic upload widget ID, preventing duplicate handlers across thread switches
- **Context window minimum** — minimum context size raised from 4K to 16K tokens; legacy values below 16K auto-clamp
- **Notify-only tasks** — tasks with `notify_only` flag skip thread creation, reducing clutter for simple timer/notification tasks
- **Skill editor simplified** — removed tool-dependency checkboxes from the skill editor UI (tools declared in SKILL.md frontmatter are informational, not enforced)

### 🧪 Tests

- **886 PASS**, 0 FAIL, 1 WARN (up from 842 in v3.9.0)
- New: Status monitor panel (20 tests), OAuth token health checks (7 tests), Arxiv tool rewrite (6 tests), image persistence & hydration, Mermaid auto-fence, PDF export (Playwright + fallback), filesystem image display, vision file analysis, streaming format pipeline, badge parsing

## v3.9.0 — Modular UI, Thinking Models & Cloud Model Expansion

Thoth's monolithic 6,500-line frontend is now a **clean modular architecture** — `app.py` + a `ui/` package of 15 focused modules. **Thinking model support** lands with full reasoning-token extraction, collapsible thinking bubbles, and persistence across thread reloads. **OpenRouter gets first-class support** via `ChatOpenRouter`, and a new **Data Analyst** bundled skill rounds out the skill library to 10. Multiple rendering fixes (URL auto-linking, YouTube embeds) and a privacy improvement round out the release.

### 🏗️ UI Modularization

The monolith `app_nicegui.py` (6,535 lines) has been replaced by `app.py` + `ui/` package using a strangler-fig migration pattern.

- **15 focused modules** — `state.py` (dataclasses), `constants.py`, `head_html.py`, `helpers.py` (config, file processing, exports), `render.py` (message rendering), `streaming.py` (generation consumer, send/interrupt), `setup_wizard.py`, `settings.py`, `graph_panel.py` (knowledge graph vis), `sidebar.py`, `home.py`, `tasks_ui.py`, `voice_bar.py`, `export.py`, `__init__.py`
- **Zero functionality loss** — every feature from the monolith is preserved; all imports resolve cleanly
- **Launcher updated** — `launcher.py`, both installer scripts (Windows ISS + macOS build), CI workflow, test suite, and all documentation updated to reference the new entry point

### 💡 Thinking Model Support

Full support for reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1, Qwen3, QwQ, etc.) across local and cloud providers.

- **Reasoning token extraction** — `additional_kwargs["reasoning_content"]` is extracted from streaming chunks before content, surfacing the model's chain-of-thought in real time
- **`reasoning=True`** — all four `ChatOllama` instantiation sites now enable native reasoning mode
- **`<think>` tag stripping** — models that embed `<think>…</think>` blocks in content have them separated into thinking tokens and stripped from the visible response
- **Collapsible thinking bubble** — during streaming, thinking content displays live in italic at 55% opacity, then auto-collapses into a `💭 Thinking` expansion with `psychology` icon when the real response begins
- **Thinking persistence on thread reload** — `load_thread_messages()` now recovers reasoning content from both `additional_kwargs` and `<think>` tags in the LangGraph checkpoint; historical messages render a collapsed thinking expansion matching the live-streaming style

### ☁️ Cloud Model Expansion

- **ChatOpenRouter** — OpenRouter models now use `langchain-openrouter`'s dedicated `ChatOpenRouter` class instead of the generic `ChatOpenAI` wrapper, enabling proper provider-specific features
- **New dependency** — `langchain-openrouter` added to `requirements.txt`

### 📊 Data Analyst Skill

- **New bundled skill** — `bundled_skills/data_analyst/SKILL.md` (v1.1) — guides the agent through dataset analysis, statistical summaries, and insightful Plotly chart creation
- **10 bundled skills total** — Brain Dump, Daily Briefing, Data Analyst, Deep Research, Humanizer, Meeting Notes, Proactive Agent, Self-Reflection, Task Automation, Web Navigator

### 🔗 Rendering Fixes

- **URL auto-linking** — bare `https://` URLs in messages now automatically render as clickable links; a regex preprocessor safely skips URLs already inside markdown links, angle brackets, inline code, or fenced code blocks
- **YouTube embed fix** — `render_text_with_embeds()` rewritten to match the full `**[text](youtube_url)**` context, eliminating `**` and `)**` artifacts that appeared when YouTube links were wrapped in markdown bold/link syntax

### 📊 Chart Tool Fixes

- **Reliable chart rendering** — chart tool improvements for consistent Plotly chart creation and inline display

### 🔒 Privacy

- **User content removed from logs** — `send_message()` no longer logs `agent_input_preview` (the first 200 characters of the user's message); log now shows only file names and content lengths

### 📁 Housekeeping

- **`workflows.py` removed** — fully superseded by `tasks.py` since v3.5.0; dead code deleted
- **Version bump** — v3.8.0 → v3.9.0 across installers, CI, documentation, and landing page
- **Test suite** — all `app_nicegui` references updated to `app`

## v3.8.0 — Bundled Skills, Memory Intelligence & Self-Contained Installers

Thoth ships with **9 bundled skills** — reusable instruction packs that shape how the agent thinks and responds. The memory system gets smarter with **auto-linking, FAISS fallback search, background orphan repair, and memory decay**. Token counting is now accurate via **tiktoken**, and the agent dynamically adjusts its tool set based on available context. Installers are now fully **self-contained** (no post-install downloads), and a new **CI/CD pipeline** automates builds, code signing, notarization, and GitHub Releases.

### 🧩 Bundled Skills Engine

New `skills.py` engine and `bundled_skills/` directory — a system for packaging and injecting domain-specific instructions into the agent's behavior.

- **SKILL.md format** — each skill is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter (`display_name`, `icon`, `description`, `tools`, `tags`, `version`, `author`, `enabled_by_default`) followed by freeform instructions
- **9 bundled skills** — 🧠 Brain Dump, ☀️ Daily Briefing, 🔬 Deep Research, 🗣️ Humanizer, 📋 Meeting Notes, 🎯 Proactive Agent, 🪞 Self-Reflection, ⚙️ Task Automation, 🌐 Web Navigator
- **Two-tier discovery** — bundled skills ship read-only in `<app_root>/bundled_skills/`; user skills in `~/.thoth/skills/` override bundled skills by name
- **Prompt injection** — enabled skills have their instructions injected into the system prompt before every LLM call
- **Per-skill enable/disable** — toggle skills from Settings → Skills tab; config persisted in `~/.thoth/skills_config.json`
- **Tool-aware** — each skill declares the tools it uses (`tools` field in frontmatter)
- **In-app skill editor** — create and edit user skills from Settings → Skills with a visual form — name, icon, description, tools, and freeform instructions; no need to manually create `SKILL.md` files
- **Cache & reload** — skills are cached in memory after first load; `load_skills(force_refresh=True)` forces a re-scan

### 🧠 Memory Intelligence

Four improvements to the knowledge graph that make memory recall smarter and the graph healthier.

- **Auto-link on save** — when a new entity is saved, the engine automatically scans existing entities for potential relationships and creates links, building the knowledge graph organically without manual `link_memories` calls
- **FAISS fallback search** — if the primary semantic recall returns no results above the 0.80 similarity threshold, a broader relaxed search is attempted automatically; prevents empty recall on edge-case queries
- **Background orphan repair** — a periodic background process detects entities with zero relationships and attempts to link them to related entities, keeping the knowledge graph connected over time
- **Memory decay** — memories that haven't been recalled recently are gradually deprioritized in retrieval results, ensuring frequently relevant information surfaces first

### 📏 Accurate Token Counting & Dynamic Tool Budgets

Context window management is now more precise and adaptive.

- **tiktoken integration** — token counting uses OpenAI's `tiktoken` library (cl100k_base encoding) instead of character-based estimates; the live token counter and all trimming decisions are now accurate to the token
- **Dynamic tool budgets** — the agent automatically adjusts how many tools are exposed to the model based on available context headroom; when context usage is high, lower-priority tools are temporarily hidden to prevent the system prompt from crowding out conversation history
- **Cloud model context fix** — `contextvars.ContextVar` now correctly propagates model overrides through the full agent pipeline, fixing a bug where cloud model threads could miscalculate available context

### 📦 Self-Contained Installers

Both Windows and macOS installers now bundle all dependencies at build time — no post-install downloads.

- **Windows (`build_installer.ps1`)** — patches Python's `._pth` file, installs pip, and runs `pip install -r requirements.txt` into the bundled Python during the build step; `install_deps.bat` and `get-pip.py` removed from the installer
- **macOS (`build_mac_app.sh`)** — new self-contained build script using python-build-standalone; downloads a standalone Python, installs all pip deps, assembles a `.app` bundle with entitlements, code-signs, and creates a `.pkg` installer
- **Inno Setup (`thoth_setup.iss`)** — updated to include `bundled_skills/` and `workflows.py`; removed post-install dependency download steps

### 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

New `.github/workflows/release.yml` — automated build, sign, notarize, and release.

- **Trigger** — tag push (`v*`) or manual `workflow_dispatch`
- **Test stage** — runs full test suite before building
- **Parallel builds** — Windows (Inno Setup) and macOS (build_mac_app.sh) build in parallel
- **macOS code signing** — signs the `.app` and `.pkg` with Apple Developer certificates (Application + Installer)
- **macOS notarization** — submits the `.pkg` to Apple for notarization and staples the ticket
- **GitHub Release** — creates a draft release with both platform installers attached
- **6 GitHub secrets** — `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_P12`, `APPLE_INSTALLER_P12`, `APPLE_CERT_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `APPLE_APP_PASSWORD`

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Cloud model override propagation** — `contextvars.ContextVar` replaces thread-local storage for model overrides, fixing context window miscalculation in cloud model threads
- **User entity prompt** — memory extraction prompt updated to fix entity naming for the canonical "User" node
- **Memory content merge** — fixed a bug where merging duplicate entities could lose content from the richer entry

### 🌐 Per-Thread Browser Tabs & Background Browsing

Browser automation now works in background tasks. Each thread (interactive chat or scheduled task) gets its own isolated browser tab.

- **Per-thread tab isolation** — replaced the single shared page with a `_thread_pages` dict; each thread claims or creates its own tab; the agent never hijacks tabs belonging to other threads
- **Blank-page-only claiming** — only pages at `about:blank` or `chrome://newtab/` are eligible for claiming; pages with content from prior sessions are never auto-claimed
- **Background browsing** — removed `_block_if_background()` entirely; browser tools now work in background tasks through per-thread tab isolation
- **Browser crash recovery** — if the browser is closed externally, a `disconnected` handler detects it, clears stale state, and the next browser action automatically relaunches the session
- **Retry on close** — `_run_on_pw_thread()` catches "has been closed" errors, resets the session, and retries once
- **Tab cleanup on task completion** — `run_task_background` finally block calls `kill_session(thread_id)` to close the task's tab
- **Screenshot thread-awareness** — `take_screenshot(thread_id)` uses a new `get_page_for_screenshot()` that never creates tabs or steals focus from other threads

### 📊 Monitoring / Polling Tasks

New task pattern for monitoring conditions and self-disabling when met.

- **`{{task_id}}` template variable** — `expand_template_vars()` now supports `{{task_id}}`; lets prompts reference their own task for self-management
- **System prompt triage** — 4-line monitoring hint helps the agent distinguish "check X and notify me when Y" (monitoring task) from simple reminders
- **SKILL.md guidance** — Task Automation skill gained items 17–21: interval schedules, conditional prompts, persistent threads, polling template, self-disable vs self-delete

### 🔴 Error Notification Improvements

API errors are now visible, persistent, and survive thread refresh.

- **Red persistent toast** — `notify()` gained a `toast_type` parameter; API errors fire `toast_type="negative"` → red banner, no auto-dismiss, close button
- **Error persistence in checkpoint** — error messages are written to the LangGraph checkpoint via `update_state()` so they appear when the thread is refreshed or revisited
- **Content normalization** — `_normalise_content()` handles gpt-5.4 list-type `AIMessage.content` in streaming and memory extraction

### 🛡️ Agent Robustness

- **Recursion limits** — raised from 25 to 50 (interactive) / 100 (background tasks); wind-down warning injected at 75% asking the model to wrap up; 4× repeated tool-call loop detection
- **Thread rendering fix** — `load_thread_messages()` now handles interrupted tool-call loops (orphaned `ToolMessage` without matching `AIMessage`)

### 🧪 Tests

- **842 PASS**, 0 FAIL, 2 WARN (up from 841 in v3.8.0 baseline)
- New: per-thread tab isolation test (19g), `{{task_id}}` expansion test (24j2)
- Updated: `kill_session` assertion (19e), security audit assertion (32g)
- Removed: `_block_if_background` test (replaced by per-thread tabs)
- Context-size-aware browser snapshot test scaling

## v3.7.0 — Cloud-Primary Mode, Per-Thread Model Switching & Task Stop

Thoth now works **without Ollama**. Connect your OpenAI or OpenRouter API key and use cloud models (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, etc.) as your default — or mix cloud and local models across different conversations. A new **per-thread model picker** lets you switch models mid-conversation, and a **task stop** feature lets you cancel running tasks at any point.

### ☁️ Cloud-Primary Mode

New `models.py` cloud engine — Thoth can now run entirely on cloud LLMs with no local Ollama dependency.

- **Dual-provider support** — connect OpenAI (direct API) and/or OpenRouter (100+ models from all major providers); keys stored in `api_keys.json` and managed via Settings → Cloud
- **Setup wizard** — fresh installs present two paths: **🖥️ Local (Ollama)** or **☁️ Cloud (API key)**; cloud path validates keys, fetches available models, and lets you pick a default — no Ollama needed
- **Starred models** — star your favorite cloud models in Settings → Cloud; starred models appear in the chat header model picker alongside local models
- **Cloud-first startup** — when the default model is cloud, Thoth skips Ollama auto-start entirely; no "Ollama not found" warnings on machines without it
- **Context-size catalog** — OpenRouter model metadata is cached locally; for OpenAI models (which don't expose context length), a built-in heuristic table covers GPT-4o/4.1/4.5/5, o1/o3/o4, Claude 2–4, and Gemini 2–3 families
- **Cloud vision detection** — cloud models with vision capability (e.g. `gpt-4o`, `claude-3.5-sonnet`) are auto-detected from provider metadata; the vision tool works seamlessly with cloud models
- **Privacy controls** — Settings → Cloud includes toggles for auto-recall, memory extraction, and conversation history; memory extraction defaults to OFF for cloud threads

### 🔀 Per-Thread Model Switching

Every conversation can now use a different model — cloud or local.

- **Chat header model picker** — dropdown in the chat header shows: "Default (current model)" + starred cloud models + local Ollama models; selecting a model sets the override for that thread only
- **Thread-level persistence** — `model_override` column added to `thread_meta` (auto-migrated); overrides survive app restarts
- **Cloud warning banner** — when a thread uses a cloud model, a colored banner shows: "☁️ Using gpt-4o via OpenAI — data is sent to the cloud"
- **Sidebar icons** — threads show ☁️ (cyan) for cloud models, 🖥️ (grey) for local models
- **Reset to default** — selecting "Default" in the picker clears the override; thread reverts to the app-wide default model
- **Summarization uses override** — context compression uses the thread's override model, not the global default
- **Telegram /model command** — `/model` lists available models; `/model gpt-4o` switches; `/model default` resets; invalid model names show an error with available options

### ⏹️ Task Stop / Cancel

Running tasks can now be stopped from the UI at any point during execution.

- **Node-level cancellation** — when a task has a `stop_event`, `invoke_agent()` uses `agent.stream(stream_mode="updates")` instead of `agent.invoke()`, checking the stop event between every LangGraph node; tasks stop between steps, not mid-LLM-call
- **`TaskStoppedError`** — new exception raised when a stop is detected; caught by the task runner for clean shutdown
- **`stop_task(thread_id)`** — signals the stop event for a running task; returns `True` if found
- **Three stop buttons** — red stop button in: (1) chat header when viewing a running task's thread, (2) Activity tab "Running Now" section per task, (3) task card (replaces the play button while running)
- **Stopped state** — stopped tasks are recorded as status "stopped" in run history; thread is renamed with "(stopped)"; orange `stop_circle` icon in Recent Runs; notification sent; delivery and auto-delete are skipped
- **Delete stops task** — deleting a thread while a task is running now signals `stop_task()` first; thread stays deleted (no ghost re-creation)
- **Thread existence guard** — task completion/stop handlers check if the thread still exists before renaming, preventing `INSERT ON CONFLICT` from re-creating deleted threads
- **Orphaned tool-call repair** — if stopped mid-tool-call, orphaned tool calls are auto-repaired before the thread is finalized
- **Backward compatible** — when `stop_event` is `None` (chat, Telegram, CLI), `invoke_agent()` uses the original `agent.invoke()` path unchanged

### 🔧 Displaced Tool-Call Repair

New repair logic in `invoke_agent()` fixes a class of LangGraph checkpoint corruption bugs.

- **Problem** — `trim_messages` or checkpoint corruption can displace `ToolMessage` responses away from their parent `AIMessage` with `tool_calls`, violating OpenAI's strict ordering requirement (tool_calls must be immediately followed by their ToolMessages)
- **Fix** — after trimming, a scan detects AIMessages whose tool_calls are not immediately followed by matching ToolMessages; stubs are injected in the correct position and displaced originals are removed
- **Auto-retry on orphan errors** — both `invoke_agent()` and `_stream_graph()` catch "tool_call without response" errors, run `repair_orphaned_tool_calls()`, and retry once automatically

### ⚡ FAISS Rebuild Optimization

Reduced redundant FAISS index rebuilds during memory extraction.

- **Before** — `_dedup_and_save()` called `rebuild_index()` at the end of each thread's extraction; processing 4 threads meant 4 full FAISS rebuilds (re-embedding all entities each time)
- **After** — `rebuild_index()` moved to `run_extraction()`, called once after all threads are processed; per-entity upserts are still suppressed via `_skip_reindex` during batch processing
- **Incremental upsert** — new `_upsert_index()` in `knowledge_graph.py` adds/updates a single entity vector without rebuilding the entire index; used for individual memory saves outside of batch extraction

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Scheduled tasks missing thread** — `_on_task_fire()` now calls `_save_thread_meta()` and `_set_thread_model_override()` before `run_task_background()`, matching the manual-run handler; previously scheduled tasks never created a `thread_meta` row, so threads never appeared in the sidebar and the completion handler's `_thread_exists()` guard silently skipped the final save
- **Telegram displaced tool_call** — Telegram channel now propagates `model_override` from thread config to the LangGraph configurable, fixing "tool_call without response" errors when using cloud models via Telegram
- **Memory system concurrent access** — additional `threading.Lock()` protection around FAISS operations during incremental upserts
- **Email channel import** — fixed minor import path issue in `channels/email.py`
- **Conversation search tool** — minor fix for result formatting
- **Voice module** — minor compatibility fix

### 🧪 Tests

- **745 PASS**, 0 FAIL, 2 WARN (up from 676 in v3.6.0)
- New test sections: Cloud model engine (model detection, provider routing, context heuristics, starred models, vision detection)
- New test sections: Per-thread model override (DB migration, override persistence, picker logic, cloud banner, sidebar icons)
- New test sections: Task stop (TaskStoppedError, stop_event propagation, stop_task(), get_running_task_thread(), stopped state handling, thread existence guard, delete-while-running)
- New test sections: Displaced tool-call repair (stub injection, displaced ToolMessage removal, ordering validation)
- New test sections: FAISS incremental upsert, rebuild optimization
- Extended integration tests for cloud model routing and Telegram /model command

## v3.6.0 — Knowledge Graph, Memory Visualization & Triple Extraction

Thoth now builds a **personal knowledge graph** from your conversations — a connected web of people, places, facts, and their relationships. Memories are no longer isolated records: they are linked entities that the agent can traverse, explore, and reason about. A new interactive **Memory tab** visualizes the graph in real time, and the extraction pipeline now produces structured triples (entity + relation + entity) instead of flat facts.

### 🕸️ Knowledge Graph Engine

New `knowledge_graph.py` — the foundation for all memory storage, replacing the standalone SQLite + FAISS implementation that lived in `memory.py`.

- **Entity-relation model** — every memory is now an entity with a type, subject, description, aliases, tags, and structured properties; entities are connected by typed, directional relations (e.g. `Dad --[father_of]--> User`, `User --[lives_in]--> London`)
- **Triple storage** — SQLite `entities` + `relations` tables with full CRUD; WAL mode for concurrent reads; cascade delete removes orphaned relations when an entity is deleted
- **NetworkX in-memory graph** — a `DiGraph` mirror of the database, rebuilt on startup, used for all traversals and pathfinding; updated atomically on every write
- **FAISS vector index** — unchanged Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B embeddings for semantic similarity; now indexes entity descriptions from the graph layer
- **Alias resolution** — entities can have comma-separated aliases (e.g. "Mom, Mother, Mama"); `find_by_subject()` checks both the `subject` column and the `aliases` column via normalized substring matching, preventing duplicates across names
- **Graph-enhanced recall** — `graph_enhanced_recall(query, top_k, threshold, hops)` first retrieves semantically similar entities via FAISS, then expands N hops in the NetworkX graph to include connected neighbors; the agent sees both the entity and the relationships that connect it
- **Backward-compatible wrapper** — `memory.py` is now a thin delegation layer (~80 lines) that maps legacy column names (`category` to `entity_type`, `content` to `description`) so all existing callers (agent, tools, extraction, UI) work without changes
- **Graph statistics** — `get_graph_stats()` returns entity count, relation count, connected components, and category breakdown for the Settings panel and Memory tab

### 🗺️ Interactive Memory Visualization

A new **Memory tab** on the home screen renders the knowledge graph as an interactive network diagram using vis-network.

- **vis-network integration** — bundled `vis-network.min.js` (9.1.9), served as a static file; renders a force-directed physics simulation in a full-height dark canvas
- **Color-coded entity types** — each category (person, place, fact, preference, event, project) has a distinct color; relation edges show their type as a label
- **Search bar** — live client-side filtering; type a name and the graph highlights matching nodes and fades everything else
- **Entity-type filter buttons** — toggle visibility of entire categories (e.g. show only people and places); buttons are generated dynamically from the data
- **Full map / ego-graph toggle** — switch between the complete graph and a focused 2-hop neighborhood around a selected node
- **Clickable detail card** — clicking a node shows a floating card with the entity's type, description, aliases, tags, source, and a list of all its relationships
- **Fit-to-view button** — resets the camera to fit all visible nodes
- **Live refresh** — graph data is reloaded from the database every time you switch to the Memory tab, so newly extracted entities appear immediately
- **Stats bar** — shows total memories and connections at the top of the panel; expanded stats in Settings show connected components and category breakdown

### 🔗 Memory Tool: Link & Explore

Two new sub-tools on the Memory tool give the agent direct access to the knowledge graph:

- **`link_memories`** — create a typed relationship between any two entities by ID; the agent can say *"Link Mom to Mom's Birthday Party with relation has_event"*; validates both entities exist and returns a confirmation with the relation details
- **`explore_connections`** — traverse the graph outward from an entity; returns all neighbors up to N hops with their relationship types and details; useful for questions like *"Tell me about my family"* or *"What do you know about my work?"*; capped at 3 hops to prevent excessive traversal

### 🧬 Triple-Based Extraction Pipeline

The background extraction pipeline now produces structured triples instead of flat entity records.

- **Entity + Relation extraction** — the LLM prompt now asks for two types of objects: entities (category/subject/content/aliases) and relations (relation_type/source_subject/target_subject/confidence); a worked example in the prompt guides the model
- **"User" entity convention** — the user is always represented by the entity with subject "User"; when the user says *"My name is Alex"*, extraction creates an alias on the User entity rather than a separate "Alex" entity; all user-facing relations use "User" as the source or target
- **Relation type taxonomy** — the prompt includes 30+ suggested relation types across family, social, location, work, preference, and temporal categories, encouraging consistent labeling
- **Two-pass dedup** — Pass 1 saves/updates entities while building a `subject-to-id` map (pre-populated with the User entity), with alias merging; Pass 2 resolves relation subjects to entity IDs and creates relations in the graph
- **Cross-category dedup** — `find_by_subject(None, subject)` searches across all categories, so a "Dad" stored as `person` won't be duplicated when extraction classifies a related fact as `event`
- **Alias-as-list fix** — handles LLMs that return aliases as a JSON array instead of a comma-separated string

### 🔄 Agent Recall Upgrade

Auto-recall now uses the knowledge graph instead of flat semantic search.

- **Graph-enhanced auto-recall** — before every LLM call, the agent retrieves relevant entities via `graph_enhanced_recall()` with 1-hop expansion, so related entities are surfaced alongside direct matches
- **Relation context in recalled memories** — recalled memories now include their graph connections (e.g. "connected via: Dad --> father_of --> User"), giving the agent richer context for answering relational questions
- **System prompt update** — new BUILDING CONNECTIONS and EXPLORING CONNECTIONS sections guide the agent on when to use `link_memories` and `explore_connections`

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Aliases-as-list crash** — fixed `AttributeError` when the extraction LLM returned aliases as a JSON array instead of a comma-separated string
- **Extraction relation resolution** — relations with unresolvable subjects (no matching entity in the DB or current batch) are silently skipped instead of crashing
- **Memory visualization toolbar reliability** — fixed intermittent loss of filter buttons and broken Fit button on the Memory tab; root cause was `ui.add_body_html()` accumulating persistent `<script>` tags on every panel rebuild, causing racing IIFE closures with stale data; replaced with `ui.run_javascript()` (no persistent tags), added teardown that destroys the old vis.Network and cancels stale boot timers, moved vis-network library load to `<head>` (once per page), and made `thothGraphRedraw` perform a full reinit (filter pills + event handlers + network) instead of just re-creating the network
- **Email channel feedback loop** — sent replies weren't marked as read, so the Email channel re-processed its own outbound messages in an infinite loop; fixed by calling `_mark_as_read(service, sent_id)` after both `_send_reply()` and `_send_reply_and_get_id()`
- **macOS MPS/FAISS crash** — `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` defaulted to MPS on Apple Silicon, causing dtype mismatches when FAISS (CPU-only) consumed the tensors; fixed by forcing `model_kwargs={"device": "cpu"}` in `documents.py`
- **FAISS concurrent-access crash** — concurrent calls to `rebuild_index()` and `semantic_search()` could corrupt the in-memory FAISS index; fixed by adding a `threading.Lock()` around all FAISS read/write operations in `knowledge_graph.py`
- **Conversation export 0-byte files on Windows** — thread names containing colons (from timestamps like `02:20 AM`) caused NTFS Alternate Data Streams instead of normal files; exports appeared as 0-byte files with no extension; fixed by sanitizing `\ / : * ? " < > |` from export filenames before writing

### 🚀 Out-of-Box Tool Defaults

Three tools that previously required manual setup are now **enabled by default** on fresh installs, with sensible defaults that work immediately.

- **Filesystem** — enabled by default; workspace auto-defaults to `~/Documents/Thoth` (created on first use); `move_file` added to default operations (protected by interrupt gate — user must approve before execution); `file_delete` still requires opt-in
- **Shell** — enabled by default; already has 3-tier safety (safe commands auto-execute, moderate commands require user approval via interrupt, dangerous commands are blocked outright)
- **Browser** — enabled by default; lazy-launched on first use (no overhead if unused); uses system Chrome/Edge if available, falls back to Playwright's bundled Chromium

### 📬 Telegram Tool & File Pipeline

New **Telegram tool** (`tools/telegram_tool.py`) — the agent can now send messages, photos, and documents to any Telegram chat via the configured bot.

- **3 sub-tools** — `send_telegram_message`, `send_telegram_photo`, `send_telegram_document`; all accept a `chat_id` parameter (defaults to the configured channel)
- **File path resolution** — workspace-relative paths are automatically resolved to absolute paths before sending; works for both Telegram and Gmail attachments
- **Chart PNG export** — `save_to_file` parameter on the Chart tool lets the agent save charts as PNG files (via kaleido) for attaching to messages or emails
- **PDF export** — new `export_to_pdf` operation on the Filesystem tool creates PDF reports from text content (via fpdf2)
- **Gmail attachments** — `send_gmail_message` and `create_gmail_draft` now accept an `attachments` list; files are MIME-encoded and attached via `_build_mime_message()`; missing files are silently skipped with a warning in the message body

### 📨 Channel Resilience & Interrupt Handling

Both the Telegram and Email channels now handle interrupts (destructive action approvals) robustly, with matching logic across both adapters.

- **List-of-dicts interrupt data** — `_format_interrupt()` handles both single interrupt dicts and lists of dicts (produced by multi-step tool chains); extracts the description from each item
- **Interrupt ID propagation** — `_extract_interrupt_ids()` pulls tool-call IDs from interrupt data for correct LangGraph `resume()` targeting; both `_resume_agent_sync()` implementations pass `interrupt_ids` to avoid replaying stale interrupts
- **Corrupt thread recovery** — both channels detect corrupt checkpoints (orphaned tool calls without results) via `_is_corrupt_thread_error()` pattern matching; users receive a friendly message asking them to start a new thread instead of a raw traceback
- **HTML formatting** — Telegram channel formats agent responses as HTML (`parse_mode="HTML"`) with proper escaping for special characters
- **Email sender filter** — the Email channel only processes messages from the authenticated user's own address (`from:{my_email}` in the Gmail query), preventing unauthorized triggering

### 🔒 Task-Scoped Background Permissions

Background tasks now support fine-grained permission controls for operations that would normally require interactive approval.

- **Tiered tool filtering** — background tasks no longer blanket-strip all destructive tools; instead, a tiered system applies:
  - **Always allowed in background**: `workspace_move_file`, `move_calendar_event`, `send_gmail_message` (low-risk or guarded at runtime)
  - **Allowed with runtime guard**: `run_command` (shell) checks against a per-task command prefix allowlist; `send_gmail_message` checks against a per-task recipient allowlist
  - **Always blocked in background**: `workspace_file_delete`, `delete_calendar_event`, `delete_memory`, `tracker_delete`, `task_delete` (irreversible)
- **Per-task allowlists** — two new fields on each task: `allowed_commands` (shell command prefixes) and `allowed_recipients` (email addresses); stored as JSON arrays in `tasks.db`
- **Shell tool runtime guard** — in background mode, commands classified as `needs_approval` are checked against `allowed_commands` (case-insensitive prefix match); blocked patterns (e.g. `rm -rf`) are still rejected before the allowlist check; safe commands (e.g. `dir`, `echo`) always execute
- **Gmail tool runtime guard** — in background mode, all recipients (to/cc/bcc) are validated against `allowed_recipients` (case-insensitive); any disallowed recipient blocks the send
- **UI configuration** — the task editor has a new "🔒 Background permissions (optional)" expandable section with two textareas (one-per-line entry); if the allowlist is blank and the task needs the operation, it fails with a user-friendly error directing the user to configure permissions in the task editor
- **No LLM awareness required** — the agent writes prompts naturally; the permission system operates transparently at the tool execution layer

### 🛡️ Security: ContextVar Background Flag

Fixed a critical security issue where the background-mode flag did not propagate to LangGraph executor threads.

- **Bug**: `threading.local()` was used for `_tlocal.background_workflow`, but LangGraph runs tool functions in separate executor threads where `threading.local()` values are not inherited — so `is_background_workflow()` always returned `False` in tool execution, bypassing background safety gates
- **Fix**: Replaced with `ContextVar` (`_background_workflow_var`), which correctly propagates to child threads via Python's `contextvars` module; updated all 6 references across `agent.py`, `tasks.py`, and `workflows.py`
- **Impact**: Shell tool and Gmail tool background guards now work correctly; `_wrap_with_interrupt_gate()` properly detects background mode in executor threads

### 🧪 Tests

- **676 PASS**, 0 FAIL, 2 WARN (up from 408 in v3.5.0)
- 3 new offline test sections: Knowledge Graph core (section 26, 55 tests), Graph Visualization (section 27, 28 tests — includes 7 visualization reliability regression tests), Triple Extraction (section 28, 18 tests)

## v3.5.0 — Task Engine, Channel Delivery & Configurable Compression

Complete rewrite of the automation engine — workflows and timers are replaced by a unified **Task Engine** with APScheduler, 7 schedule types, per-task model override, channel delivery (Telegram / Email), persistent run history, a redesigned home screen dashboard, and configurable retrieval compression.

### ⚡ Task Engine (replaces Workflows + Timer)

The old `workflows.py` + `timer_tool.py` are replaced by a single `tasks.py` module backed by APScheduler.

- **7 schedule types** — `daily`, `weekly`, `weekdays`, `weekends`, `interval` (minutes), `cron` (full cron expression), `delay_minutes` (one-shot quick timer with notify-only)
- **SQLite persistence** — `tasks.db` with `tasks` + `task_runs` tables; all schedule formats, delivery config, and model override stored per task
- **Auto-migration** — on first launch, existing `workflows.db` entries are migrated to `tasks.db` automatically; old daily/weekly schedules map to the new types
- **APScheduler integration** — tasks are registered as APScheduler jobs on startup; fire times, pause/resume, and next-run queries come from the scheduler directly
- **Per-task model override** — each task can specify a different LLM; the engine loads the override model, runs the task, then restores the default; retry fallback if the override model fails (HTTP 500)
- **Template variables** — `{{date}}`, `{{day}}`, `{{time}}`, `{{month}}`, `{{year}}` expanded at runtime in prompt steps
- **5 default templates** — Daily Briefing, Research Summary, Email Digest, Weekly Review, and Quick Reminder (new)
- **Run history persistence** — `task_runs` rows survive task deletion (no FK cascade); `get_recent_runs()` uses LEFT JOIN + COALESCE so history displays even after the parent task is removed
- **Status tracking** — each run records `status` (`completed` / `failed` / `completed_delivery_failed`), `status_message`, `task_name`, and `task_icon` columns

### 📋 Task Tool (replaces Timer Tool)

New `tools/task_tool.py` with 5 sub-tools (up from 3 in the old timer):

- `task_create` — create a scheduled task with any of the 7 trigger types
- `task_list` — list all tasks with next fire times
- `task_update` — update task name, prompts, schedule, delivery, or model override
- `task_run_now` — execute a task immediately
- `task_delete` — delete a task (requires user confirmation via interrupt gate)

### 📡 Channel Delivery

Tasks can now deliver their output to a messaging channel after execution.

- **`delivery_channel`** + **`delivery_target`** fields on each task — supports `telegram` (chat ID) and `email` (address + subject)
- **`_validate_delivery()`** — pre-flight check ensures the channel is configured and reachable before the task runs
- **`_deliver_to_channel()`** — sends the task's last LLM response to the configured channel; returns `(status, message)` tuple
- **`completed_delivery_failed`** status — task succeeds but delivery fails (channel error, empty response, etc.)
- **Telegram `send_outbound(chat_id, text)`** — new method on the Telegram channel; captures the bot event loop; RuntimeError guard for missing loop
- **Email `send_outbound(to, subject, body)`** — new method on the Email channel; sends via Gmail OAuth

### 🏠 Dashboard Redesign

- **Tabbed home screen** — two tabs: **⚡ Tasks** (task tiles with edit/run/delete) and **📋 Activity** (monitoring panel)
- **Task Edit dialog** — inline editor for name, icon, prompts, schedule, delivery channel, and model override
- **Activity panel** — 5 sections: Running Now (progress + spinner), Upcoming (next fire times from APScheduler), Recent Runs (last 10 with ✅/❌/⏳ icons), Memory Extraction status, Channel status (🟢/🔴)
- **Settings Workflows tab removed** — 12 → 11 settings tabs; task management moved to the home screen
- **Wider layout** — `max-w-5xl` → `max-w-7xl` for better use of wide screens

### 🔍 Configurable Retrieval Compression

Retrieval-based tools (Documents, Wikipedia, Arxiv, Web Search) now support 3 compression modes, selectable from Settings → Search:

- **Smart** (default) — `EmbeddingsFilter` with cosine similarity threshold 0.5; fast, no extra LLM call; preserves source metadata and citations
- **Deep** — `LLMChainExtractor`; sends each retrieved document through the LLM for precise extraction; slower but highest relevance
- **Off** — no compression; returns raw retrieved chunks as-is

Global config stored in `tools_config.json` under the `"global"` key via `registry.get_global_config()` / `set_global_config()`.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Model override 500 errors** — retry fallback when per-task model fails to load
- **Context size cap** — `get_llm_for()` uses `min(model_max, user_setting)` to prevent context overflows
- **Model swap during override tasks** — `_model_override_var` ContextVar propagates override model name to `_get_compressor()` and `_do_summarize()`, preventing GPU model eviction
- **Delivery content bug** — `invoke_agent()` returns `str`, not `dict`; fixed `isinstance(result, dict)` check that was always False
- **Empty delivery** — tasks now deliver even when `last_response` is empty (falls back to status message)
- **Telegram error propagation** — `send_outbound` now properly raises on failure instead of silently swallowing errors
- **Email error propagation** — same fix for the Email channel

### 🧪 Tests

- **408 PASS**, 0 FAIL, 2 WARN (up from 322)
- 4 new test sections: Task Tool (§21, 11 tests), Activity Tab (§22, 10 tests), Channel Delivery (§23, 20 tests), Task Engine + Compression (§24–25, 45 tests)

## v3.4.0 — Browser Automation

Full browser automation via Playwright, giving the agent the ability to navigate websites, click elements, fill forms, and manage tabs in a visible Chromium window — plus browser snapshot compression for long browsing sessions and a fix for the gold color regression.

### 🌐 Browser Tool

A new `browser_tool.py` module gives the agent 7 browser sub-tools for autonomous web browsing in a real, visible browser window.

- **Shared visible browser** — runs with `headless=False` so the user can see what the agent is doing and intervene (e.g. type passwords, solve CAPTCHAs)
- **Persistent profile** — `launch_persistent_context()` stores cookies, logins, and localStorage in `~/.thoth/browser_profile/` so sites stay logged-in across restarts
- **Accessibility-tree snapshots** — after every action the tool captures the page's accessibility tree, assigning numbered references (`[1]`, `[2]`, …) to interactive elements so the model can click/type by number
- **Smart snapshot filtering** — deduplicates links, drops hidden elements, soft-caps at 100 interactive elements, and truncates at 25K chars to stay within context limits
- **7 sub-tools**:
  - `browser_navigate` — go to a URL
  - `browser_click` — click an interactive element by its reference number
  - `browser_type` — type text into an input element by reference number
  - `browser_scroll` — scroll the page up or down
  - `browser_snapshot` — take a fresh accessibility snapshot of the current page
  - `browser_back` — go back one page in browser history
  - `browser_tab` — manage tabs (list, switch, new, close)
- **Browser channel detection** — automatically detects installed Chrome, then Edge (Windows), then falls back to Playwright's bundled Chromium
- **PID-scoped crash recovery** — detects stale browser processes from previous crashes and cleans up the profile lock before relaunching
- **Background workflow blocking** — browser actions are blocked when running inside a background workflow

### 🧠 Browser Snapshot Compression

Long browsing sessions (6–10+ actions) can produce 150K+ characters of accessibility snapshots, easily overflowing the context window. A new pre-model trimming pass compresses older browser results.

- **Keep last 2 snapshots in full** — the two most recent browser tool results are sent to the LLM unmodified
- **Compact stubs for older results** — older snapshots are replaced with a one-line stub containing the URL, page title, and action name (`[Prior browser navigate — URL: …, Title: …. Full snapshot omitted to save context.]`)
- **Checkpoint preservation** — only the LLM-visible copy is trimmed; full snapshots remain in the conversation checkpoint for the UI

### 🎨 Gold Color Fix

- **Root cause** — NiceGUI 3.8.0's `ui.html()` defaults to `sanitize=True`, which uses the browser's `setHTML()` Sanitizer API; a WebView2 auto-update between March 12–18 enabled the Sanitizer, which strips inline `style` attributes — breaking all gold-colored text
- **Fix** — added `sanitize=False` to all 18 `ui.html()` calls in `app_nicegui.py` to bypass the Sanitizer API

### 🛠️ Other Improvements

- **Sidebar tagline** — changed from *"Your Knowledgeable Personal Agent"* to *"Personal AI Sovereignty"*
- **System prompt updates** — `prompts.py` updated with BROWSER AUTOMATION routing rules, guiding the agent to use `browser_*` tools when the user mentions browsing and `read_url` only for raw text extraction
- **Test suite** — 293 → 322 tests (added browser tool registration, sub-tool count, snapshot filtering, crash recovery, tab management, and channel detection tests)

### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| **`tools/browser_tool.py`** | **New** — browser automation tool with `BrowserSession`, `_detect_channel()`, 7 sub-tools, accessibility snapshot with smart filtering, PID-scoped crash recovery, persistent profile |
| **`agent.py`** | Browser snapshot compression in `_pre_model_trim()` — keeps last 2 full, stubs older snapshots |
| **`app_nicegui.py`** | `sanitize=False` on all 18 `ui.html()` calls (gold fix); sidebar tagline changed to *"Personal AI Sovereignty"* |
| **`tools/__init__.py`** | Added `browser_tool` import |
| **`prompts.py`** | BROWSER AUTOMATION routing rules in system prompt |
| **`requirements.txt`** | Added `playwright~=1.58` |
| **`test_suite.py`** | Browser tool tests (293 → 322) |

## v3.3.0 — Shell Access & Stop Button

Full shell access with safety classification, a reliable stop button with clean generation cancellation, and filesystem sandboxing improvements.

### 🖥️ Shell Tool

A new `shell_tool.py` module gives the agent the ability to run shell commands on the user's machine — making Thoth a true system assistant.

- **Persistent sessions** — each conversation thread gets its own shell session; `cd`, environment variables, and other state persists across commands
- **3-tier safety classification** — every command is classified before execution:
  - **Safe** (auto-executes) — read-only commands like `ls`, `pwd`, `cat`, `git status`, `pip list`, `echo`, `df`
  - **Moderate** (user approval required) — system-modifying commands like `pip install`, `apt`, `brew`, `kill`, `chmod`, `rm`
  - **Blocked** (rejected outright) — dangerous commands like `shutdown`, `reboot`, `mkfs`, `:(){ :|:& };:`
- **Background workflow blocking** — shell commands are automatically blocked when running inside a background workflow to prevent unattended destructive actions
- **Inline terminal panel** — command output appears in a collapsible terminal panel in the chat UI with clear and history controls
- **History persistence** — command history is saved per-thread in `~/.thoth/shell_history.json` and reloaded when you revisit a conversation
- **Session cleanup** — shell sessions and history entries are cleaned up when threads are deleted

### ⏹️ Stop Button Overhaul

The stop button has been rebuilt from scratch for reliable generation cancellation.

- **`threading.Event` cancellation** — replaces the old boolean flag with a proper `threading.Event` for race-free stop signalling
- **Drain mechanism** — after stop is signalled, the consumer drains the streaming queue until the producer's sentinel `None` arrives or a 30-second timeout expires, preventing stale tokens from leaking into the next generation
- **Checkpoint marker** — a `⏹️ *[Stopped]*` marker is appended to the conversation checkpoint so thread reloads show that a generation was interrupted (works for both mid-thinking and mid-tool-call stops)
- **Orphaned tool call repair** — `repair_orphaned_tool_calls()` now unconditionally appends the stop marker, fixing mid-tool-call stops where no orphans exist but the generation was still interrupted
- **UI feedback** — stop button shows an hourglass icon during the drain phase

### 📁 Filesystem Sandboxing

- **`workspace_*` tool renaming** — all filesystem tools are now prefixed with `workspace_` (e.g. `workspace_read_file`, `workspace_list_directory`) so the LLM understands their scope is limited to the configured workspace folder
- **Out-of-workspace rejection** — file operations targeting paths outside the workspace are rejected with a clear error message directing the agent to use `run_command` instead
- **Filesystem vs Shell routing rules** — the system prompt now includes explicit routing guidelines: `workspace_*` tools for files inside the workspace, `run_command` for anything outside

### 🛠️ Other Improvements

- **Settings tab reorder** — the 12 Settings tabs have been reordered for better workflow (Models first, then Memory, Voice, Workflows, System, Tracker, etc.)
- **System tab** — the old "Filesystem" settings tab has been renamed to "System" with a terminal icon, now containing both filesystem workspace configuration and shell settings
- **Terminal panel UI** — inline terminal panel in chat with toggle bar, auto-show on shell output, clear button, and history reload on thread switch
- **Agent prompt updates** — `prompts.py` updated with FILESYSTEM vs SHELL ROUTING rules, destructive tool name updates, and shell usage guidance
- **Test suite** — 270 → 293 tests (added shell tool tests, stop button tests, filesystem sandboxing tests)

### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| **`tools/shell_tool.py`** | **New** — shell tool with `ShellSession`, `ShellSessionManager`, `classify_command()`, 3-tier safety, persistent sessions, history |

## v3.2.0 — Smart Context & Memory Overhaul

Automatic conversation summarization for unlimited conversation length, a complete rewrite of the memory deduplication system, and centralized prompt management.

### 🧠 Memory System Overhaul

The memory deduplication pipeline has been completely rewritten to fix a critical bug where background extraction could create duplicates or update the wrong memory.

#### Deterministic Dedup (replaces semantic dedup)
- **`find_by_subject()` for live saves** — when the agent saves a memory, an exact normalised-subject lookup (SQL) checks if one already exists in the same category; if it does, the richer content is kept silently — no duplicates created
- **Cross-category dedup for extraction** — background extraction now passes `category=None` to `find_by_subject()`, matching against all categories. This prevents fragmentation when the extraction LLM classifies a fact differently than the live tool (e.g. a birthday saved as `person/Dad` won't be re-created as `event/Dad`)
- **Why not semantic?** — semantic similarity (cosine) proved unreliable for dedup: short extracted content ("Priya") vs rich live content ("User's sister is named Priya and she lives in Manchester") scored only 0.78 — well below any safe threshold. Semantic search remains the right tool for *recall*; deterministic SQL is the right tool for *dedup*

#### Source Tracking
- **`source` column** — every memory is tagged `live` (agent during chat) or `extraction` (background scanner) for diagnostics
- **Migration** — existing databases are automatically migrated via `ALTER TABLE`

#### Active Thread Exclusion
- **`set_active_thread()` API** — the UI layer tells the extractor which thread is currently active; background extraction skips it to avoid race conditions with the live agent

#### Extended Update
- **`update_memory()`** — now accepts optional `subject`, `tags`, `category`, and `source` keyword arguments, not just content

#### Consolidation
- **`consolidate_duplicates(threshold)`** — utility to scan and merge near-duplicate memories that may have accumulated over time

#### Auto-Recall with IDs
- **Memory IDs in context** — auto-recalled memories now include their IDs (`[id=abc123]`) so the agent can use `update_memory` or `delete_memory` with the exact ID when the user corrects or retracts previously saved information

#### Prompt Guidance
- **DEDUPLICATION section** — system prompt tells the agent that `save_memory` handles dedup automatically
- **UPDATING MEMORIES section** — system prompt instructs the agent to use `update_memory` with the recalled ID for corrections, not create a new memory

### 📝 Context Summarization

A new automatic summarization system that compresses older conversation turns, enabling effectively unlimited conversation length within any context window.

- **Automatic trigger** — when token usage exceeds 80% of the context window, a background summarization compresses older conversation turns into a running summary
- **Protected turns** — the 5 most recent turns are never summarized, preserving immediate conversational context
- **Hard trim safety net** — a secondary 85% budget drops the oldest non-protected messages if summarization alone isn't enough
- **Transparent** — the summary is injected as a system message; the user experience is seamless

### 📄 Centralized Prompts

- **New `prompts.py` module** — all LLM prompts extracted from inline strings into a single file: `AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `EXTRACTION_PROMPT`, `SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT`
- **Easier tuning** — modify agent behavior, extraction rules, or summarization instructions in one place

### 🛠️ Other Improvements

- **URL Reader** — `MAX_CHARS` increased from 12,000 → 30,000 for more complete page reads
- **System prompt polish** — improved URL reader guidance, documents tool instructions, YouTube transcript handling, consolidated honesty directives
- **Test suite** — 233 → 270 tests (added context summarization tests + 40 memory system integrity tests)

### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| **`prompts.py`** | **New** — centralized LLM prompts |
| **`memory.py`** | `source` column, `find_by_subject()`, `find_duplicate()`, `consolidate_duplicates()`, `_normalize_subject()`, extended `update_memory()` and `save_memory()` |
| **`memory_extraction.py`** | `_dedup_and_save()` rewritten (deterministic dedup), `set_active_thread()` API, active thread exclusion |
| **`tools/memory_tool.py`** | `_save_memory()` rewritten with deterministic dedup via `find_by_subject()` |
| **`agent.py`** | Context summarization (`_maybe_summarize()`, `_pre_model_trim()`), auto-recall with memory IDs, prompts extracted to `prompts.py` |
| **`app_nicegui.py`** | `set_active_thread()` wired into thread management |
| **`tools/url_reader_tool.py`** | `MAX_CHARS` 12K → 30K |
| **`test_suite.py`** | Sections 16 (context summarization) and 17 (memory integrity) added |

## v3.1.0 — macOS Support & Kokoro TTS

Cross-platform macOS support and a complete TTS engine migration from Piper to Kokoro.

### 🍎 macOS Support

- **Native macOS installer** — `Start Thoth.command` — double-click in Finder to install and launch; auto-installs Homebrew, Python 3.12, and Ollama if not present
- **Apple Silicon & Intel** — works on M1/M2/M3/M4 and Intel Macs (macOS 12+)
- **Thoth.app bundle** — auto-generated `.app` with option to copy to /Applications for Dock/Launchpad access
- **CI-built macOS zip** — GitHub Actions builds the macOS release on a real macOS runner with correct Unix permissions
- **Cross-platform codebase** — all Python modules updated to work on both Windows and macOS (platform-specific imports, path handling, sound playback)

### 🔊 Kokoro TTS (replaces Piper)

- **New TTS engine** — Kokoro TTS via ONNX Runtime replaces Piper TTS on all platforms
- **Cross-platform** — Kokoro runs natively on Windows, macOS (Apple Silicon & Intel), and Linux — Piper only worked on Windows/Linux
- **10 built-in voices** — 5 American (4 female, 1 male), 3 American male, 1 British female, 1 British male (up from 8 Piper voices)
- **Auto-download** — model files (~169 MB) are downloaded automatically on first TTS use; no bundling required in the installer
- **Same streaming UX** — sentence-by-sentence playback, mic gating, code block skipping — all preserved
- **Smaller installer** — Windows installer reduced from ~90 MB to ~30 MB (Piper engine + voice no longer bundled)

### 🛠️ Infrastructure

- **CI updated** — GitHub Actions `ci.yml` now includes a `build-mac-release` job that builds the macOS zip on `macos-latest` and uploads as an artifact
- **Test suite** — 205 tests passing (added Kokoro TTS tests, all platforms)
- **Windows installer** — Piper download steps removed from `build_installer.ps1` and `thoth_setup.iss`

## v3.0.0 — NiceGUI, Messaging Channels & Habit Tracker

Complete frontend rewrite from Streamlit to NiceGUI, new messaging channel adapters for Telegram and Email, and a conversational habit/health tracking system.

### 📋 Habit & Health Tracker

A new conversational tracker for logging and analysing recurring activities — medications, symptoms, exercise, periods, mood, sleep, or anything you want to track over time.

#### Tracking
- **Natural-language logging** — tell the agent *"I took my Lexapro"* or *"Headache level 6"* and it offers to log the entry; no forms or dashboards needed
- **Auto-create trackers** — trackers are created on first mention; supports boolean, numeric, duration, and categorical types
- **Backfill** — log entries with a past timestamp: *"I took my meds at 8am"*
- **3 sub-tools** — `tracker_log` (structured input), `tracker_query` (free-text read-only), `tracker_delete` (destructive, requires confirmation via interrupt)

#### Analysis
- **7 built-in analyses** — adherence rate, current/longest streaks, numeric stats (mean/min/max/σ), frequency (per week/month), day-of-week distribution, cycle estimation (period tracking), co-occurrence between any two trackers
- **Trend queries** — *"Show my headache trends this month"* returns stats + exports CSV for charting
- **Chart chaining** — CSV exports are passed to the existing Chart tool for interactive Plotly visualisations (bar, line, scatter, etc.)
- **Co-occurrence** — *"Do headaches correlate with my period?"* compares two trackers within a configurable time window

#### Privacy & Integration
- **Fully local** — SQLite database at `~/.thoth/tracker/tracker.db`; CSV exports in `~/.thoth/tracker/exports/`
- **Memory separation** — tracker data is excluded from the memory extraction system; logging meds won't pollute your personal knowledge base
- **Agent prompt integration** — system prompt instructs the agent to confirm before logging and to chain to `create_chart` for visual outputs

### 🎯 Context-Size Capping

- **Automatic model-max enforcement** — if you select a context window larger than the model's native maximum (e.g. 64K on a 40K-max model), trimming and the token counter automatically use the model's actual limit instead of the user-selected value
- **Model metadata query** — `get_model_max_context()` queries Ollama's `show()` API for the model's `context_length` and caches the result per model
- **Toast notifications** — a warning toast appears when changing models or context size if the selection exceeds the model's native max, explaining which value will actually be used
- **Settings info label** — the Models tab shows an inline note below the context selector when capping is active

---

### 🖥️ NiceGUI Frontend

The entire UI has been rewritten using [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/), replacing Streamlit. The new frontend runs on port **8080** and offers a faster, more responsive experience with true real-time streaming.

- **Full feature parity** — all existing functionality ported: chat interface, sidebar thread manager, settings dialog (now 11 tabs), file attachments, streaming, voice bar, export, workflows
- **Real-time updates** — no more page reloads; token streaming, tool status, and toast notifications update instantly via websocket
- **System tray launcher** — `launcher.py` updated to manage the NiceGUI process
- **Native desktop window** — runs in a native OS window via pywebview instead of a browser tab; `--native` flag passed by default from the launcher
- **Two-tier splash screen** — branded splash (dark background, gold Thoth logo, animated loading indicator) displays while the server starts; tries tkinter GUI first, falls back to a console-based splash if tkinter is unavailable; runs as an isolated subprocess to avoid Tcl/threading conflicts with pystray; self-closes when port 8080 responds
- **First-launch setup wizard** — on first run, a guided dialog lets the user pick a brain model and vision model and download them before the main UI loads
- **Explicit download buttons** — model downloads in Settings are triggered by dedicated Download buttons instead of auto-downloading on selection

### 📬 Messaging Channels

New `channels/` package with two messaging channel adapters:

#### Telegram Bot
- **Long-polling adapter** — connect a Telegram bot via Bot API token
- **Full agent access** — messages are processed by the same ReAct agent with all tools available
- **Thread per chat** — each Telegram chat gets its own conversation thread with a 📱 icon
- **Settings UI** — configure bot token, start/stop, and auto-start on launch from Settings → Channels tab

#### Email Channel
- **Gmail polling** — polls inbox at configurable intervals for new messages
- **OAuth 2.0 authentication** — uses existing Gmail OAuth credentials with re-authenticate button
- **Smart filtering** — responds only to emails from approved senders list
- **Thread per sender** — each email sender gets a dedicated thread with a 📧 icon
- **Auto-start** — channels can be set to auto-start when Thoth launches

### 🔧 Infrastructure

- **Version bump** — v2.2.0 → v3.0.0
- **Installer updated** — Inno Setup script updated for NiceGUI, channels package included; `._pth` patched at install time to add the app directory for channels import; tkinter bundled from system Python for embedded environment
- **Dependencies** — `streamlit` replaced by `nicegui`; `pywebview` added for native window; `pythonnet` added for Python 3.14 compatibility; added missing packages (`apscheduler`, `plyer`, `youtube-search`, `numpy`, `requests`, `pydantic`) to `requirements.txt`
- **Structured logging** — comprehensive `logging` added across 14 modules (`models`, `tts`, `threads`, `api_keys`, `documents`, `agent`, `app_nicegui`, `tools/registry`, `tools/base`, `tools/gmail_tool`, `tools/calendar_tool`, `tools/weather_tool`, `tools/conversation_search_tool`, `tools/system_info_tool`); all output written to `~/.thoth/thoth_app.log` via stderr capture
- **Log noise suppression** — noisy third-party loggers (`httpx`, `httpcore`, `urllib3`, `sentence_transformers`, `transformers`, `huggingface_hub`, `googleapiclient`, `primp`, `ddgs`, `nicegui`, `uvicorn`, etc.) silenced to WARNING+; tqdm/safetensors weight-loading spam suppressed by redirecting stderr during embedding model init; `OPENCV_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR` set at startup
- **Ollama launch fix** — launcher starts `ollama app.exe` (tray icon) instead of bare `ollama serve` for proper Windows integration
- **Unicode fix** — `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` set at startup to prevent cp1252 crashes on non-ASCII model output
- **Lazy FAISS initialization** — embedding model and vector store are now lazy-loaded via getter functions to avoid double-initialization caused by NiceGUI's `multiprocessing.Process` (Windows spawn) re-importing the module
- **Old Streamlit app** — `app.py` kept in repo but git-ignored; not deleted

---

## v2.2.0 — Workflows

A new workflow engine for reusable, multi-step prompt sequences with scheduling support.

---

### ⚡ Workflow Engine

Create named workflows — ordered sequences of prompts that run in a fresh conversation thread. Each step sees the output of the previous one, enabling chained research → summarisation → action pipelines.

#### Core Features
- **Multi-step prompt sequences** — define 1+ prompts that execute sequentially in a single thread
- **Template variables** — `{{date}}`, `{{day}}`, `{{time}}`, `{{month}}`, `{{year}}` are replaced at runtime
- **Live streaming** — workflows stream in real-time with a step progress indicator in the chat header
- **Background completion** — navigate away mid-workflow and it continues silently; the sidebar shows a running indicator
- **Desktop notifications** — scheduled and background runs trigger a Windows notification on completion

#### Scheduling
- **Daily schedule** — run a workflow automatically at a specific time every day
- **Weekly schedule** — run on a specific day and time each week
- **Scheduler engine** — background thread checks for due workflows every 60 seconds
- **Enable/disable** — toggle scheduled workflows on or off without deleting the schedule

#### UI
- **Home screen tiles** — workflows appear as clickable cards on the home screen (no thread selected) with Run buttons
- **Inline quick-create** — create new workflows directly from the home screen
- **Settings → Workflows tab** — full management view with name, icon, description, prompt editor (add/remove/reorder steps), schedule config, run history
- **Duplicate & Delete** — one-click workflow cloning and deletion
- **Run history** — past executions shown per workflow with timestamps, step counts, and status

#### Pre-built Templates
Ships with 4 starter workflows that can be customised or deleted:
- **📰 Daily Briefing** — top news + weather + today's calendar (3 steps)
- **🔬 Research Summary** — search latest AI developments + summarise with citations (2 steps)
- **📧 Email Digest** — check Gmail inbox + summarise by priority (2 steps)
- **📋 Weekly Review** — past week's calendar events + review and recommendations (2 steps)

#### Safety
- **Destructive tool exclusion** — background workflow runs automatically exclude destructive tools (send email, delete files, etc.) so they can never execute unattended; the LLM adapts by using safe alternatives (e.g. creating a draft instead of sending)
- **Scheduler double-fire prevention** — `last_run` is set immediately when a scheduled workflow triggers, before execution begins, preventing duplicate runs within the cooldown window

### 🔔 Unified Notification System

A new `notifications.py` module replaces scattered notification calls with a single `notify()` function that fires across three channels simultaneously:

- **Desktop notifications** — via plyer, with timestamped messages showing when the task actually completed
- **Sound effects** — via winsound (lazy-imported for cross-platform safety), played asynchronously in a background thread
- **In-app toasts** — queued for the next Streamlit rerun via `drain_toasts()`, with emoji icons

#### Sound Files
- `sounds/workflow.wav` — two-tone chime (C5→E5) on workflow completion
- `sounds/timer.wav` — 5-beep alert (A5) for timer expiration

Both generated as clean sine-wave tones via Python's `wave` module.

### 🎨 UI Polish

- **Sidebar running indicator** — simplified from step count (`⏳ 2/4`) to just `⏳` since the sidebar doesn't auto-refresh
- **Settings tab renamed** — "🎛️ Preferences" → "🎤 Voice" to better describe the tab's contents
- **Workflow emoji picker** — replaced free-text icon input with a selectbox of 20 curated emojis
- **Streamlit sidebar toggle** — added `.streamlit/config.toml` with `toolbarMode = "minimal"` and `hideTopBar = true`

### 📦 Dependency & Compatibility

- **`streamlit>=1.45`** pinned in `requirements.txt` for `st.tabs` stability
- **`winsound` lazy import** — non-Windows platforms gracefully skip sound playback instead of crashing

#### Technical Details
- **New modules** — `workflows.py` (workflow engine + scheduler), `notifications.py` (unified notify + toast queue)
- **New assets** — `sounds/workflow.wav`, `sounds/timer.wav`
- **New config** — `.streamlit/config.toml` (sidebar/toolbar settings)
- **Prompt chaining** — first step streams live, subsequent steps continue via `stream_agent` or fall back to `invoke_agent` in background
- **Thread naming** — workflow threads are prefixed with ⚡ and include the workflow name and timestamp
- **Settings tab count** — Settings dialog now has 10 tabs (added Workflows, renamed Preferences → Voice)
- **Background flag** — `threading.local()` (`_tlocal`) flags background workflows; agent graph cache key includes `bg:{True/False}` for separate tool sets
- **Timer tool updated** — replaced inline `_notify()` with `notifications.notify()` for consistent sound + desktop + toast

## v2.1.0 — Semantic Memory & Voice Simplification

A major upgrade to the memory system and a complete simplification of the voice pipeline.

---

### 🧠 Semantic Memory System

The memory system has been upgraded from keyword-based search to full **FAISS semantic vector search** with automatic recall and background extraction.

#### Semantic Search
- **FAISS vector index** — memories are now embedded with `Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B` and stored in a FAISS index at `~/.thoth/memory_vectors/`
- **Cosine similarity search** — `semantic_search()` replaces the old keyword `LIKE` queries for much better recall on indirect/paraphrased queries
- **Auto-rebuild** — the FAISS index automatically rebuilds on any memory mutation (save, update, delete)

#### Auto-Recall
- **Automatic memory injection** — before every LLM call, the current user message is embedded and the top-5 most relevant memories (threshold ≥ 0.35) are injected as a system message
- **Assertive phrasing** — recalled memories are presented as "You KNOW the following facts about this user" so the model treats them as ground truth
- **System prompt reinforcement** — the agent is explicitly instructed to save buried personal info alongside other requests

#### Background Memory Extraction
- **LLM-powered extraction** — on startup and every 6 hours, past conversations are scanned by the LLM to extract personal facts (names, preferences, projects, etc.)
- **Semantic deduplication** — extracted facts are compared against existing memories using cosine similarity; duplicates (> 0.85) update existing entries, novel facts create new ones
- **Incremental scanning** — only conversations updated since the last extraction run are processed
- **State persistence** — extraction timestamps tracked in `~/.thoth/memory_extraction_state.json`
- **New module** — `memory_extraction.py` added to the codebase

### 🎤 Voice Pipeline Simplification

The voice pipeline has been completely rewritten for reliability and simplicity.

#### What Changed
- **Removed wake word detection** — no more OpenWakeWord, ONNX models, or "Hey Jarvis"/"Hey Mycroft" activation
- **Removed `wake_models/` directory** — deleted all bundled ONNX wake word model files
- **Removed auto-timeout and heartbeat** — no more inactivity timer or browser heartbeat polling
- **Removed follow-up mode** — no more timed mic re-open window after TTS playback
- **Removed tool call announcements** — TTS no longer speaks tool names aloud during execution

#### New Design
- **Toggle-based activation** — simple manual toggle to start/stop listening
- **4-state machine** — clean state transitions: `stopped` → `listening` → `transcribing` → `muted`
- **CPU-only Whisper** — faster-whisper runs exclusively on CPU with int8 quantization for consistent performance
- **Medium model support** — added `medium` to the Whisper model size options (tiny/base/small/medium)
- **Voice-aware responses** — voice input is tagged with a system hint so the agent responds conversationally
- **Status safety net** — auto-unmutes when TTS finishes but pipeline state is stuck on "muted"

### 🔊 TTS Markdown-to-Speech Improvements

The `_MD_STRIP` regex pipeline in `tts.py` has been overhauled for cleaner speech output:
- Fixed bold/italic/strikethrough pattern ordering (triple before double before single)
- Added black circle, middle dot, and additional bullet character stripping
- Added numbered list prefix stripping (both `1.` and `1)` styles)
- Moved bullet stripping before emphasis patterns to prevent partial matches
- Removed broken `_italic_` pattern

### 🚀 Startup UX Revamp

- **Live progress steps** — replaced generic "Loading models…" spinner with `st.status` widget showing each initialization step (core modules, documents, models, API keys, voice/TTS, vision, memory extraction)
- **No flicker on reruns** — startup UI only shows on first run; thread switches and page reruns skip it entirely via session state gate
- **Clean banner removal** — startup status wrapped in `st.empty()` placeholder for clean removal after load

### 🧹 Cleanup

- **Deleted `wake_models/` directory** — removed all bundled ONNX wake word model files (alexa, hey_jarvis, hey_mycroft, hey_thought)
- **Cleaned installer references** — removed wake_models from `installer/thoth_setup.iss` and `installer/README.md`
- **Removed OpenWakeWord dependency** — no longer referenced in codebase or acknowledgements

### 📦 Data Storage Updates

Two new entries in `~/.thoth/`:
- `memory_vectors/` — FAISS index (`index.faiss`) and ID mapping (`id_map.json`) for semantic memory search
- `memory_extraction_state.json` — tracks last extraction run timestamp per thread

### 🧹 Codebase Changes

- **Added**: `memory_extraction.py` (background extraction + dedup + periodic timer)
- **Updated**: `memory.py` (FAISS vector index, `semantic_search()`, `_rebuild_memory_index()`, shared embedding model)
- **Updated**: `agent.py` (auto-recall injection in `_pre_model_trim`, updated system prompt for memory awareness)
- **Updated**: `voice.py` (complete rewrite — 4-state toggle machine, CPU-only int8 Whisper, no wake word)
- **Updated**: `tts.py` (overhauled `_MD_STRIP` patterns, removed tool call announcements)
- **Updated**: `app.py` (startup UX revamp, memory extraction integration, voice simplification)
- **Updated**: `tools/memory_tool.py` (`search_memory` now uses `semantic_search()`)
- **Updated**: `installer/thoth_setup.iss` (removed wake_models references)
- **Updated**: `installer/README.md` (removed wake_models from bundled files)
- **Deleted**: `wake_models/` directory (4 ONNX files)

## v2.0.0 — ReAct Agent Rewrite

**A complete architectural overhaul.** Thoth v2 replaces the original RAG pipeline with a fully autonomous ReAct agent that can reason, use tools, and carry persistent memory across conversations.

---

### 🏗️ Architecture: RAG Pipeline → ReAct Agent

The original Thoth (v1.x) used a custom LangGraph `StateGraph` with three nodes (`needs_context` → `get_context` → `generate_answer`) to decide whether retrieval was needed, fetch context, and generate cited answers. This worked well for Q&A but couldn't take actions, compose emails, manage files, or remember things.

**Thoth v2** replaces this with a LangGraph `create_react_agent()` — a reasoning loop where the LLM autonomously decides which tools to call, interprets results, and continues until it has a complete answer. The agent can chain multiple tools, retry with different queries, and combine information from several sources in a single turn.

Key changes:
- **`rag.py` removed** — the custom RAG state machine is gone
- **`agent.py` added** — new ReAct agent with system prompt, pre-model message trimming, streaming event generator, and interrupt mechanism
- **Smart context management** — pre-model hook trims history to 80% of context window; oversized tool outputs (e.g. multiple PDFs) are proportionally shrunk so multi-file workflows fit; file reads capped at 80K characters
- **Tool system** — new `tools/` package with `BaseTool` ABC, auto-registration registry, and 19 self-registering tool modules
- **42 sub-tools** exposed to the model (up from 4 retrieval sources)

### 🔧 17 Integrated Tools

Every tool is a self-registering module in `tools/` with configurable enable/disable, API key management, and optional sub-tool selection.

#### Search & Knowledge (7 tools)
- **🔍 Web Search** — Tavily-powered live web search with contextual compression
- **🦆 DuckDuckGo** — free web search fallback, no API key required
- **🌐 Wikipedia** — encyclopedic knowledge retrieval with compression

- **▶️ YouTube** — video search + full transcript/caption fetching
- **🔗 URL Reader** — fetch and extract clean text from any web page
- **📄 Documents** — semantic search over user-uploaded files via FAISS vector store

#### Productivity (4 tools)
- **📧 Gmail** — search, read, draft, and send emails via Google OAuth; operations tiered into read/compose/send with individual toggles
- **📅 Google Calendar** — view, search, create, update, move, and delete events via Google OAuth; shares credentials with Gmail
- **📁 Filesystem** — sandboxed file operations (read, write, copy, move, delete) within a user-configured workspace folder; reads PDF, CSV, Excel (.xlsx/.xls), JSON/JSONL, and TSV files; structured data files parsed with pandas (schema + stats + preview); large reads capped at 80K chars; operations tiered into safe/write/destructive
- **⏰ Timer** — desktop notification timers with SQLite persistence via APScheduler; supports set, list, and cancel

#### Computation & Analysis (6 tools)
- **🧮 Calculator** — safe math evaluation via simpleeval — arithmetic, trig, logs, factorials, combinatorics, all `math` module functions
- **🔢 Wolfram Alpha** — advanced computation, symbolic math, unit/currency conversion, scientific data, chemistry, physics
- **🌤️ Weather** — current conditions and multi-day forecasts via Open-Meteo (free, no API key); includes geocoding, wind direction, and WMO weather code descriptions
- **👁️ Vision** — camera capture and screen capture with analysis via Ollama vision models; configurable camera and vision model selection
- **🧠 Memory** — persistent personal knowledge base with save, search, list, update, and delete operations across 6 categories
- **🔍 Conversation Search** — natural language search across all past conversations; keyword matching over checkpoint history with thread names and dates
- **🖥️ System Info** — full system snapshot via psutil: OS, CPU, RAM, disk space per drive, local & public IP, battery status, and top 10 processes by CPU usage
- **📊 Chart** — interactive Plotly charts from data files; structured spec tool supporting bar, horizontal_bar, line, scatter, pie, donut, histogram, box, area, and heatmap; reads from workspace files or cached attachments; auto-picks columns when x/y are omitted; dark theme with interactive zoom/hover/pan

### 🧠 Long-Term Memory

A completely new feature. The agent can now remember personal information across conversations:

- **6 categories**: `person`, `preference`, `fact`, `event`, `place`, `project`
- **Agent-driven saving** — the agent recognizes when you share something worth remembering and saves it automatically
- **Cross-conversation recall** — search and retrieve memories from any conversation
- **Full CRUD** — save, search, list, update, and delete memories via natural language
- **SQLite storage** at `~/.thoth/memory.db` with WAL mode
- **Settings UI** — browse, search, filter by category, and bulk-delete from the Memory tab
- **Destructive confirmation** — deleting memories requires explicit user approval

### 👁️ Vision System

New camera and screen capture integration:

- **Webcam analysis** — *"What's in front of me?"*, *"Read this document I'm holding up"*
- **Screen capture** — *"What's on my screen?"*, *"Describe what I'm looking at"*
- **Configurable models** — choose from gemma3, llava, and other Ollama vision models
- **Multi-camera support** — select which camera to use from Settings
- **Inline display** — captured images appear in the chat alongside the analysis

### 🎤 Voice Input

- **Wake word detection** — 2 built-in wake words (Hey Jarvis, Hey Mycroft) via OpenWakeWord ONNX models
- **Speech-to-text** — faster-whisper with selectable model size (tiny/base/small)
- **Configurable sensitivity** — wake word threshold slider (0.1–0.95)
- **Audio chime** on wake word detection
- **Voice bar UI** — shows listening/transcribing status with real-time feedback
- **Mic gating** — microphone automatically muted during TTS playback to prevent echo and feedback loops
- **Follow-up mode** — after TTS finishes speaking, the mic re-opens briefly so you can ask follow-up questions without re-triggering the wake word

### 🔊 Text-to-Speech

Neural speech synthesis, fully offline:

- **Piper TTS engine** — bundled with installer at the time (engine + default voice); additional voices downloaded from HuggingFace on demand *(replaced by Kokoro TTS in v3.1.0)*
- **8 voices** — US and British English, male and female variants *(expanded to 10 voices with Kokoro in v3.1.0)*
- **Streaming playback** — responses spoken sentence-by-sentence as tokens stream in
- **Smart truncation** — long responses are summarized aloud with full text in the app
- **Code block skipping** — TTS intelligently skips fenced code blocks
- **Mic gating integration** — coordinates with voice input to mute mic during playback and re-enable after

### 💬 Chat Improvements

- **Streaming responses** — tokens appear in real-time with a typing indicator animation

- **Onboarding guide** — first-run welcome message with tool categories, settings guidance, voice tips, and file attachment instructions; 6 clickable example prompts; `?` button in sidebar to re-display; persistence via `~/.thoth/app_config.json`
- **Startup health check** — verifies Ollama connectivity and model availability on launch with user-friendly error messages
- **Conversation export** — export threads as Markdown, plain text, or PDF with formatted role headers and timestamps
- **Stop generation** — circular stop button to cancel streaming at any time- **Live token counter** — gold-themed progress bar in the sidebar showing real-time context window usage based on trimmed (model-visible) history
- **Truncation warnings** — inline warnings when file content was truncated to fit context
- **Error recovery** — agent tool loops (GraphRecursionError) are caught gracefully with a user-friendly message; orphaned tool calls are automatically repaired
### 🛡️ Destructive Action Confirmation

The agent now uses LangGraph's `interrupt()` mechanism to pause and ask for user confirmation before performing dangerous operations:

- File deletion and moves (Filesystem)
- Sending emails (Gmail)
- Moving and deleting calendar events (Calendar)
- Deleting memories (Memory)

The user sees a confirmation dialog with the action details and can approve or deny.

### ⚙️ Settings Overhaul

The Settings dialog has been expanded from a simple panel to a **9-tab dialog**:

1. **🤖 Models** — brain model selection, context window slider, vision model selection, camera picker
2. **🔍 Search** — toggle and configure search tools (Web Search, DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, Arxiv, YouTube, Wolfram Alpha) with inline API key inputs and setup instructions
3. **📄 Local Documents** — upload, index, and manage documents for the FAISS vector store
4. **📁 Filesystem** — workspace folder picker, operation tier checkboxes (read/write/destructive)
5. **📧 Gmail** — OAuth setup with step-by-step instructions, credentials path picker, authentication status, operation tier checkboxes
6. **📅 Calendar** — OAuth setup (shared credentials with Gmail), authentication, operation tiers
7. **🔧 Utilities** — toggle Timer, URL Reader, Calculator, Weather tools
8. **🧠 Memory** — enable/disable, browse stored memories, search, filter by category, bulk delete
9. **🏛️ Preferences** — voice input (wake word, Whisper model, sensitivity), TTS (voice selection, speed) *(TTS engine changed to Kokoro in v3.1.0)*

### 🖥️ System Tray Launcher

`launcher.py` provides a system tray experience:

- **Tray icon** with color-coded voice state (green = listening, yellow = processing, grey = off)
- **Manages Streamlit subprocess** on port 8501
- **Auto-opens browser** on launch
- **Polls `~/.thoth/status.json`** for live state updates
- **Graceful shutdown** — clean process termination on Quit

### 📦 Data Storage

All user data now lives in `~/.thoth/`:

- `threads.db` — conversation history and LangGraph checkpoints
- `memory.db` — long-term memories (new)
- `api_keys.json` — API keys
- `tools_config.json` — tool enable/disable state and configuration (new)
- `model_settings.json` — selected model and context size (new)
- `processed_files.json` — tracked indexed documents
- `status.json` — voice state for system tray (new)
- `timers.sqlite` — scheduled timer jobs (new)
- `gmail/` — Gmail OAuth tokens (new)
- `calendar/` — Calendar OAuth tokens (new)
- `piper/` — Piper TTS engine and voice models *(replaced by `kokoro/` in v3.1.0)*

### 🧹 Codebase Changes

- **Removed**: `rag.py` (old RAG pipeline — dead code, no longer imported)
- **Added**: `agent.py`, `memory.py`, `voice.py`, `tts.py`, `vision.py`, `launcher.py`
- **Added**: `tools/` package with 16 tool modules, `base.py` (ABC), `registry.py` (auto-registration)
- **Updated**: `app.py` (complete UI rewrite — streaming, voice bar, Settings dialog, export, attachments)
- **Updated**: `threads.py` (added `_delete_thread`, `pick_or_create_thread`)
- **Updated**: `models.py` (added context size management, vision model support)
- **Updated**: `documents.py` (moved vector store to `~/.thoth/`)
- **Default model**: Changed from `qwen3:8b` to `qwen3:14b`
